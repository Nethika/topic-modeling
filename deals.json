    "text": "CBS Corp (CBS.N) Chief Executive Leslie Moonves should get five years without interference from Sumner Redstone's family if the media company is merged with Viacom Inc (VIAB.O), investor Mario Gabelli told CNBC on Tuesday. The Redstone family's National Amusements Inc holds 80 percent of the voting shares in CBS and Viacom, and has urged the two companies to consider a merger.  \"Give him five years,\" said Gabelli, who is the second-largest owner of voting shares of both Viacom and CBS after the Redstone family.  \"Say I will stay off your case,\" he said, referring to Shari Redstone, daughter of the media magnate, who has been taking a more active role in her father's business interests in the past year. Both CBS and Viacom have formed independent board committees to consider a merger at the behest of National Amusements, but it is not clear if terms can be reached. National Amusements has said it will not support any other transaction, nor will it give up its controlling interest in the companies. Viacom, which owns Comedy Central, MTV and film studio Paramount, has been struggling with declining ratings and ad revenue. Moonves wants autonomy to run the combined company if a merger takes places, sources have told Reuters. A spokeswoman for Shari Redstone declined to comment.  "

    "date": "Tue Oct 11, 2016 | 5:21 PM EDT",

    "text": "Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N), owner of Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell chains, said on Tuesday it will more than double returns to shareholders by 2019 as part of a program started last year, sending its shares up as much as 3.8 percent. The company, which is spinning off its China division at the end of the month, now plans to expand its share buyback plan to $13.5 billion, including dividends. It already has bought back about $5.5 billion shares as part of a previously announced $6.2 billion capital return program that has reduced its share count by about 16 percent. Yum did not immediately have a breakdown on much of the extra returns would be from share repurchases and how much from dividends. Executives say Yum Brands will be leaner and less exposed to the ups and downs of the restaurant business following the separation of Yum China and the sale of more company-owned restaurants to franchisees.  \"It's about delivering higher growth with lower risk,\" Yum Brands Chief Executive Officer Greg Creed told Reuters in a telephone interview. Yum said franchisees will own 93 percent of the nearly 36,000 Yum restaurants remaining in the company after the China unit is carved off. The combined company currently is 77 percent franchised, in part because Yum China owns most of its restaurants. Yum Brands aims to have at least 98 percent of its restaurants owned by franchisees by the end of 2018, which will lower costs and increase its dependence on more stable franchise and license fees.  Yum's China business will begin trading on Nov. 1 on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol YUMC. The new company, Yum China Holdings Inc, will become a licensee of Yum Brands in mainland China and will have exclusive rights there to KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.  Yum China now accounts for 45 percent of Yum Brands' earnings, a contribution expected to fall to 14 percent after the spinoff, when Yum China will begin paying Yum Brands a license fee of 3 percent of restaurant system sales, Creed said. The company plans to reduce annual capital expenditures to about $100 million in 2019 from about $500 million in 2015 and cut general and administrative expenses by a cumulative $300 million by fiscal 2019. About half of that $300 million in new savings will come from shifting restaurant expenses to new franchisees, the remainder will come from job eliminations and tighter expense controls on things like travel, Creed said. Yum last week reported its first same-store sales drop in five quarters in China, blaming anti-U.S. protests after an international court rejected China's claim to historic rights in the South China Sea. Shares in Yum were up 1.1 percent at $88.31 after hitting a session high of $90.68. Up to Monday's close, the stock had risen about 20 percent since the start of the year.   "

    "text": "Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N) said it can triple the number of restaurants in its China division, which is being spun off after a string of sales setbacks that have raised the risk profile of the company's top profit generator.       Yum opened its first KFC in China near Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1987, beating major rivals to the country. It has been China's biggest Western restaurant operator for years and now has more than 7,300 KFC and Pizza Hut outlets there.  \"I really don't see any reason why we cannot have 20,000 restaurants in China,\" said Micky Pant, chief executive of Yum's China division, which will be spun off on Oct. 31. But Yum China's once-predictable growth has been called into question. It has grappled with internal and external challenges in recent years, including marketing blunders, rising competition, bird flu outbreaks, food safety problems and slowing economic growth. Earlier this month, executives blamed anti-U.S. protests sparked by political tensions in the South China Sea for a surprise 1 percent drop in sales at established China restaurants during the latest quarter. Pant said those sales were recovering and described the division's first same-store sales drop in five quarters as a blip, telling Reuters, \"the fundamentals of the brands in China are very strong.\" Pant said Yum China will have 15 percent earnings expansion in the world's fastest-growing economy and that it will open restaurants in burgeoning mega cities, major transportation hubs and new shopping malls. The company also plans to open Taco Bell and Little Sheep restaurants, albeit at a far slower pace than its two dominant brands. Partners Primavera Capital and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) affiliate Ant Financial, which will buy a $460 million stake in Yum China, bring competitive advantages such as local real estate market knowledge and digital leadership, Pant said. Yum China already is the biggest user of Ant's popular Alipay service and the restaurant operator is investing in making its mobile ordering system and loyalty programs even more robust, executives said. Analysts say KFC, which accounts for roughly 70 percent of Yum's restaurants in China, still has plenty of room to add new units but suggest its limit may be lower than the company's long-term target.   China has about 4 KFC stores per million people and its level of \"Peak KFC,\" or restaurant penetration, is likely to be equal to Japan's at 9 stores per million people, rather than the 13 stores per million people in the United States, Bernstein Research analyst Sara Senatore said in a recent note. Pant told Reuters he \"can absolutely see getting\" to 12 KFC restaurants per million people in China, equivalent to a tripling of the business. "

    "text": "LPL Financial Holdings Inc, the largest independent broker-dealer and registered investment adviser in the United States, is exploring strategic alternatives, including a potential sale, according to people familiar with the matter.  The move comes as LPL faces an adverse low-interest rate environment and higher costs of regulatory compliance, forcing it to lower commissions on some high-fee investment offerings and invest more in technology infrastructure and personnel.  LPL is working with investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc on a sale process that has attracted other companies and private equity firms, the people said on Tuesday. The sources cautioned that there is no certainty a deal will be reached and asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. LPL and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.  LPL shares rose as much as 11 percent on the news, and ended trading up 6.9 percent at $33.01 in New York on Tuesday, giving the company a market capitalization of around $2.9 billion. Based in Boston, LPL provides technology, clearing and compliance services, training, and independent research to more than 14,000 independent financial advisers and over 700 banks and credit unions. It provided services for approximately $502 billion in advisory and brokerage assets as of the end of August. Private equity firms TPG Capital LP and Hellman & Friedman LLC took LPL public in 2010 at $30 per share. The stock has barely gained in value since then, as the company has struggled to comply with regulations and increasing competition. LPL has faced censure and investigations from state and federal regulators over the years due to the way some of its brokers have operated, misrepresenting and even cheating clients. The company has taken actions, however, to boost compliance procedures.  In April, the U.S. Labor Department released a rule for financial brokers who sell retirement products, following a years-long clash that has involved multiple industry groups and U.S. lawmakers. The rule will require brokers who give retirement account advice to become \"fiduciaries\" and act in clients' best interests, instead of choosing products that line brokers' own pockets. The rule goes into full effect in 2018. Under existing rules, brokers have to ensure only that products are \"suitable.\" The cost of implementing the new Labor Department rule is \"not terribly significant\" to LPL given its business model, Mark Casady, the company's chairman and chief executive, told Reuters in June.

MGT said that under a new deal structure, it was terminating its asset purchase agreement and instead will license technology from D-Vasive, and make McAfee its chief executive as planned. MGT also plans to change its name to \"John McAfee Global Technologies, Inc.\" On Sept. 20, MGT said the New York Stock Exchange denied approval of the listing of 43.8 million shares that were central to its plan to buy D-Vasive. \"MGT believes that such a revised deal structure would be acceptable under NYSE MKT rules,\" MGT said. A day earlier, MGT said it had received a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission but did not believe it was or would be subject to any enforcement proceedings.  Trading in MGT's shares had been halted at a loss of 5 percent ahead of the company's press release. In May, MGT surged more than 1,200 percent after the mobile gaming company with almost no revenue announced it would transform into a cybersecurity company and be led by John McAfee. John McAfee was the subject of a media frenzy in 2012 when he fled his home in Belize after police sought to question him about the murder of a neighbor. They ultimately said he was not a suspect. MGT shares were up 71 cents, or about 40 percent, at $2.50 on Tuesday afternoon. "

    "text": "Buyout firm BC Partners Ltd is in pole position to acquire a data center business that CenturyLink Inc, a U.S. provider of phone and internet services, is hoping to divest for more than $2.5 billion, people familiar with the matter said. BC Partners emerged as the lead bidder after another private equity consortium comprising GTCR LLC, Charlesbank Capital Partners LLC, Berkshire Partners LLC and Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners, which was also pursuing the assets, broke apart without any deal reached, the people said this week. The sale process has been complicated by leases that CenturyLink has with Digital Realty Trust Inc, a company which rents out data centers, making a deal with BC Partners uncertain, the people said.  The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential.  \"As we stated in our second-quarter earnings call in early August, our strategic review process continues to progress well and we expect to complete the process by the end of this year,\" CenturyLink said in a statement. BC Partners declined to comment and Digital Realty could not immediately be reached for comment.   Data center divestitures can be difficult to complete because they involve separating assets that are deeply integrated into a telecommunications network. AT&T Inc abandoned its plans last year to sell its data centers over similar issues. CenturyLink has about 59 colocation data centers that provide space for customers to install servers and equipment that the company then helps support.  Reuters reported in January that one of CenturyLink's peers, Verizon Communications Inc, was also seeking to divest its colocation portfolio of 49 data centers. Cowen Group research analyst Colby Synesael published a note on Oct. 5 stating that a sale of Verizon's data centers was imminent and that Equinix Inc was the most likely acquirer. A source familiar with the matter said Equinix was indeed in talks to acquire these assets from Verizon. Equinix and Verizon declined to comment.  Both companies are shedding assets that were acquired in deals in 2011 at a time when owning data centers was seen as attractive for telecommunications firms. CenturyLink bought data hosting company Savvis for $2.5 billion, while Verizon spent $1.4 billion on another data center company, Terremark Worldwide, that year.  Private equity firm Silver Lake Partners is exploring a sale of Vantage Data Centers Management Co LLC in a deal it hopes will value the U.S. company at well in excess of $1 billion, including debt, sources said on Monday.

Performance Sports' Toronto-listed shares which were previously halted was trading up 8.6 pct at C$5.25, while its U.S.-listed shares were up 10.6 pct at $3.97 in afternoon trading. The company said, as previously announced, it had formed a special committee with the assistance of its financial adviser Centerview Partners LLC, and is continuing to review and evaluate strategic alternatives. Performance Sports said on Tuesday it along with Centerview had discussions with certain interested parties and stakeholders, but no agreement has been reached with a third party. Brookfield shares were down 1.3 percent at C$46.64 in afternoon trading. Brookfield raised its stake to 13.2 percent in Performance Sports in September after having said it would push for a  restructuring and a possible sale.  The asset manager is Performance Sports' second largest shareholder after Sagard Capital Partners Management Corp, according to Thomson Reuters data. The former chairman of Performance Sports, Graeme Roustan, told Reuters in August that he had hired investment banks Jefferies Group LLC and Canaccord Genuity to explore a bid.     Performance Sports Group, which said in August that it may default on its loans due to a delay in filing its annual report, had Centerview Partners Holdings LLC to help negotiate with its lenders. The company, which has been delaying its annual report citing internal investigation over its accounting, said it was the subject of inquiries by U.S. and Canadian securities regulators. Performance Sports, which has a market value of C$221.5 million, is also under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and faces a shareholder class action lawsuit. The company agreed in August to an extension to file its annual and first quarter results by Oct. 28. Should the company file for creditor protection after that date, former chairman Graeme Roustan is said to be seeking financial backing to launch a bid for Performance Sports' roughly $440 million in debt, and then take control of the company through a restructuring, Bloomberg reported.

    "text": "TOKYO Bidders for Japan's Takata Corp will meet this month with the carmakers key to its survival to consider options, including a $3 billion bid, at a gathering that could determine the future of the air-bag maker, people familiar with the matter said. Takata is seeking a financial investor to help pay for huge liabilities from the world's biggest auto recall, with defective air-bag inflators linked to at least 15 deaths globally. The meetings of the five bidding groups and carmakers, who are Takata creditors and customers, will take place late this month in New York, four people involved or briefed on the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. The bid from Japanese inflator maker Daicel Corp and U.S. buyout firm Bain Capital, for more than 300 billion yen ($2.9 billion), is backed by Takata's steering committee of Japan-based lawyers and consultants, said a person involved in the process and one who was briefed on the matter. That is the highest bid for Takata, the source briefed on the matter said. Automakers asked to meet directly with bidders, the sources said, as differences over whether to put Takata through bankruptcy complicate the discussions. Its $1.1 billion in capital is dwarfed by recall liabilities of some $10 billion, according to industry estimates, let alone potential legal liabilities. The tussle over bankruptcy is likely to delay by months earlier hopes to name a rescuer this month and complete Takata's restructuring plans this year, sources told Reuters last month. Bidders include Sweden's Autoliv, a global rival for Takata in air bags, as well as a partnership between U.S. parts supplier Key Safety Systems and private equity firm Carlyle Group, sources have said.  BANKRUPTCY DIVIDES All five bidders last month presented restructuring plans that would force the air-bag maker to file for bankruptcy protection, people with knowledge of the process have told Reuters. Takata's share price, which has collapsed 89 percent since early 2014 as the recall crisis escalated, fell 7.5 percent on Tuesday on a report that the company is weighing bankruptcy in the United States, where most of the recalls, deaths and injuries linked to Takata's defective air bags have occurred. Some automaker customers oppose bankruptcy because they would have to swallow significant losses after shouldering the bulk of recalls costs, sources have said.    Automakers are leaning towards Autoliv, the world's largest supplier of air bags, which has ramped up its production capacity of air-bag inflators to provide replacements parts as Takata has struggled to keep up, said a source briefed on the matter. Toyota Motor Corp, Honda Motor Co, Nissan Motor Co and Volkswagen will attend the meetings, the sources said. Also attending will be the steering committee, which is overseeing Takata's restructuring discussions, and investment bank Lazard Ltd, which is advising Takata on the bidding, they said. Daicel, Bain, Autoliv, KSS and Carlyle declined to comment on matters related to Takata. A spokeswoman for Takata and Lazard declined to comment. A spokesman for Honda declined to comment, while a Toyota spokesman reiterated the company's position that it was not in a position to comment on Takata's financial situation. Nissan and Volkswagen were not immediately available for comment. Bidders are trying to come up with a plan which will enable Takata to continue operating by drawing a line under its liabilities while also continuing to supply parts to the industry into the future. Automakers around the world have been recalling vehicles containing more than 100 million Takata inflators after it was discovered that a chemical compound in their propellant can explode violently, especially in vehicles with years of exposure to hot, humid weather. Increasing recalls and growing liabilities have increased financial pressures on the company which has been run by the founding Takada family since it was founded as a textile maker in 1933. The parts maker has booked an annual loss in three of the past four years and been shedding assets to raise funds. "

    "text": "PARIS/WARSAW Airbus Helicopters (AIR.PA) hit back on Tuesday at Poland's decision to cancel a multi-billion-dollar military helicopter deal, deepening a defense procurement row that has soured relations between France and its eastern European NATO ally. In an open letter to the country's prime minister, Europe's largest aerospace group accused the Warsaw government of shifting the goalposts as Airbus competed with U.S. and Italian rivals and attempting to contravene European Union regulations. Airbus Group Chief Executive Tom Enders accused Poland of misleading the company during negotiations and threatened further action, without giving details. \"Never have we been treated by any government customer the way this government has treated us,\" Enders said in a separate emailed statement. \"The controversial and contradictory declarations of the Polish government over the course of this procurement proceedings created the impression of unprecedented confusion,\" he said. Poland's previous centrist government, which was beaten by rightist Law and Justice (PiS) party in elections last October, had provisionally agreed with Airbus to buy 50 of its Caracal multi-role helicopters in April 2015 as part of efforts to modernize its military at a time of tensions with Russia. But on Oct. 4 the new government said it was scrapping the contract.  France reacted angrily, saying Paris would review defense cooperation with Poland and cancelling a presidential visit to Warsaw. Industry sources estimated the cost to Airbus of running the helicopter sales campaign at several tens of millions of euros. Polish government officials said Airbus had had ample notice to adjust its offer, which they said was not satisfactory.    \"The ending of negotiations with Airbus is fuelling an emotional reaction, that's understandable,\" Radoslaw Domagalski-Labedzki, a deputy economy minister, told reporters. \"I would like to explain the government hasn't broken the negotiations but ended them when we became certain continuing them made no sense. These negotiations lasted a year, long enough to ensure that there was no further room for compromise.\" JOBS, OFFSET     The Polish government appears to have dismissed Airbus Helicopters Chief Executive Guillaume Faury's argument that the deal would have led to the creation of 3,800 local jobs and generated more value for Poland than for Airbus itself. Speaking at a news conference in a helicopter repair factory in the city of Lodz, Prime Minister Beata Szydlo said her government wanted the army to be equipped by Polish-made kit. \"We are doing what is being done by all other countries which protect national interests,\" Szydlo said. \"For Poland, it is important we buy equipment here, in Poland.\" Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz said Warsaw planned to obtain two helicopters from the Polish factory of Sikorsky Aircraft Corp, a unit of U.S. Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), this year and eight next year. \"The Polish army needs helicopters as quickly as possible,\" Macierewicz told a joint news conference with Szydlo, adding the helicopters would be serviced in Lodz, in a plant which was  meant to be developed with Airbus under the scrapped deal. Lifting the lid on the typical secrecy surrounding defense  contracts and the economic trade-offs or \"offsets\" that typically go with them, Faury said the decision to cancel the deal came a day after Airbus had offered new concessions. He said Airbus Helicopters had offered offsets worth more than the net value of the helicopters, or 10.8 billion zlotys  ($2.8 billion). He also said the ministry of economy had slapped an additional 23 percent in value-added tax (VAT) on the deal, bringing the overall value to 13.4 billion zlotys. \"Although compensation of a value-added tax through offset is not standard practice, Airbus Helicopters agreed to compensate this gross value,\" the letter said. He said the ministry also introduced other new requirements in August, some of which Airbus had been unable to meet because they contravened European Union laws. He gave no details. Airbus said the deal would have led to the transfer of 45 items of security-sensitive technology and provided 30 years of work for state-owned companies, modernizing an industry depending on servicing \"old-generation Russian helicopters\". Faury claimed Airbus had gone further than its rivals, Lockheed Martin's (LMT.N) Sikorsky and Italy's Leonardo (LDOF.MI) in offering a state-owned assembly plant. Parent Airbus Group says it employs 900 people in Poland and spends 204 million euros annually there. "

    "text": "FRANKFURT Infineon Technologies AG (IFXGn.DE) has acquired Dutch electronics company Innoluce BV, a designer of miniature \"lidar\" laser-scanning modules that the German chip giant says can help it develop affordable sensor systems for driverless cars. The German firm's head of its automotive business said on Tuesday the acquisition of Innoluce will help it drive down the cost of light detection and ranging sensors (lidar) for use in guidance systems for mass-market vehicles. \"We intend to make lidar an affordable feature for every new-built car worldwide,\" Peter Schiefer said in a statement. Lidar employs laser beams to measure the distance to objects near a vehicle, enabling car control systems to identify road ways, traffic signs, pavement markings, and overhead bridges and other potential obstacles. But early versions of the sensor devices developed by Silicon Valley-based firm Velodyne lidar that were used by Google in its self-driving car project cost $75,000 per vehicle. Newer versions of lidar sensors cost just one-tenth of that price and Velodyne and rivals such as Quanergy are aiming to drive the cost down to hundreds of dollars per unit by miniaturizing the bulky roof-top devices. Innoluce produces the micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) modules that incorporate tiny mirrors controlled by a  computer chip that can be used to direct laser beams in the sensor systems. Financial terms of the purchase of Innoluce, a spin-off from the electronics group Philips (PHG.AS), were not disclosed. The company was founded in 2010 and is based in Nijmegen, on the Dutch-German border. Infineon's biggest rivals in the car market are also racing to develop chips to control and drive the sensors required for autonomous driving, including NXP (NXPI.O) and STMicroelectronics (STM.PA).

    "date": "Tue Oct 11, 2016 | 4:15 AM EDT",
    "authour": " Additional reporting by Denny Thomas in HONG KONG and Cod Satrusayang in BANGKOK; Editing by Will Waterman",
    "text": "SHANGHAI/HONG KONG Investors gearing up for the initial public offering of Ant Financial, the $60 billion online finance arm spun off by e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA.N), will have to wait until at least late 2017 as the business puts growth first, sources say. Sources with knowledge of the plans said Ant Financial, whose anchor business is Alipay, China's largest online payments service, is focusing on expanding its existing 450 million-strong army of daily users, adding merchants and customers. One of the sources said that, as of last month, Ant had yet to contact Chinese regulators to start the lengthy listing process and join a queue of more than 700 companies waiting to list. An Ant spokeswoman said the group had not set a timetable or location for its listing, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission did not comment. In addition to online payments, Ant Financial also offers services from wealth management to credit scoring, micro lending and insurance. Alibaba Group set up Alipay in 2004 in the PayPal (PYPL.O) mould, to help Chinese buyers shop online, and later spun it off ahead of its own listing in 2014. At its last fundraising round in April, Ant's valuation topped $60 billion - just short of the market value of Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N). Its listing has been among the most keenly awaited of recent years. It reshuffled top management at the weekend, which Alibaba founder and Chairman Jack Ma said on Tuesday in Bangkok signaled a listing was in prospect at some point. \"We will be looking at an IPO in the next few years; we are not yet sure where we will list or when exactly,\" Ma said. The sources, however, said Ant intends to list both in mainland China and Hong Kong. The two applications could be simultaneous, though a shorter waiting time could also mean that Hong Kong-listed H shares could come to market first, the sources said. \"Unicorn\" start-ups - those worth more than $1 billion - are often short on cash, but not Ant Financial. It raised $4.5 billion in a record funding round in April, backed by China's sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp and a subsidiary of China Construction Bank (0939.HK). It also turns a significant profit. New York-listed Alibaba does not have a direct stake in Ant, due to Beijing's restrictions on foreign companies owning Chinese financial institutions, but it has a 37.5 percent profit-sharing agreement. According to Alibaba filings, Ant paid it $56 million in royalty and software technology service fees in the June quarter. GROWING UP For growth, Ant is concentrating on expanding a user base that already outnumbers the population of Western Europe, growing in China and abroad, where it has focused on partnerships and also wants to capture spending by Chinese tourists when they travel. In 2015, Chinese tourists spent $215 billion overseas, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council. Earlier this year, Ant hired Goldman Sachs executive Douglas Feagin to lead the push abroad. None of the sources elaborated on how long the growth plan to boost customer and merchant numbers could take, the possible impact on profits, or whether there were specific targets to hit before the group considers itself ready to list. \"This is for long-term growth but will impact short-term financial results,\" one of the sources said of the growth push. The sources said Ant's management wants to ensure an IPO is followed by growth for its shareholders - new and old. Current shareholders include large state-owned institutions: China Life Insurance (601628.SS) (2628.HK), China Post Group -  parent of Postal Savings Bank of China - and a unit of China Development Bank. \"There is no firm plan for next year ... But the company has lots of cash, and (raising funds) won't be the only factor driving the IPO,\" said one of the sources. Some analysts have questioned the sustainability of the group's growth, particularly for its Yu'e Bao money market fund, which will have to maintain attractive rates even as the economy slows. In new markets like India, Ant's partner, payment group PayTM, is also grappling with fickle consumers, while making inroads in a giant and largely untapped market.  A key complication for Ant's listing is former parent, Alibaba. Alibaba's current profit-sharing agreement stipulates it could take up to 33 percent of equity in a listing - but that could hit regulatory hurdles designed to keep financial institutions domestically owned. Alibaba, registered in the Cayman Islands and listed in New York, is considered foreign. The sources said discussions to address that issue had begun with regulators. But for now, it's growing so fast that its headquarters in Hangzhou, southwest of Shanghai, is bursting at the seams, with rows of employees tightly packed under banners with kung fu sayings beloved of founder Ma. A new headquarters is due in early 2017. "

    "text": "BANGKOK Thai Union Group PCL (TU.BK), the world's biggest producer of canned tuna, said it has bought a minority stake in U.S. seafood chain Red Lobster Seafood Restaurants in a $575 million deal to expand in the United States, its biggest market. The company, known for its \"Chicken of the Sea\" tuna brand, said on Monday it had taken a 25 percent interest in the restaurant chain, with the option to acquire an additional 24 percent through the conversion of preferred shares.  The Thai company paid $230 million for the 25 percent stake, and $345 million for the preferred shares, which are convertible to common stock within 10 years. Private equity firm Golden Gate Capital will remain Red Lobster's majority owner and retain operational control, Thai Union said. Thai Union has been seeking to boost its business through acquisitions after it scrapped a $1.5 billion deal to buy U.S. rival Bumble Bee Seafoods in December. The Thai company is a supplier to Red Lobster, as well as to Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O). CEO Thiraphong Chansiri told reporters in Bangkok on Tuesday the company is considering issuing bonds and seeking long-term loans this year to refinance the $575 million in bridge loans it took to fund the acquisition so that its debt-to-equity ratio does not exceed 1.1 times.  Thai Union has received six-month bridge loans of 20 billion baht ($575 million) from three domestic banks - Bangkok Bank (BBL.BK), Siam Commercial Bank (SCB.BK) and Bank of Ayudhya (BAY.BK) - for the purchase, Thiraphong said. The Thai firm is on track to achieve a revenue target of $8 billion by 2020 and expected revenue of $5 billion in 2016, the CEO said.  Golden Gate Capital acquired Red Lobster for about $2.1 billion in July 2014 from Darden Inc (DRI.N), the parent of the Olive Garden chain of restaurants. Thai Union bought Canadian lobster processor Les Pecheries de Chez Nous for an undisclosed amount earlier this year. "

    "text": "Insurance mergers and acquisitions rarely raise red flags with U.S. national security watchdogs. China's Fosun International Ltd (0656.HK) took that history to heart last year when it paid $1.84 billion for the remaining 80 percent stake of U.S. property and casualty insurer Ironshore Inc that it did not already own. But in December 2015, one month after Fosun completed the acquisition, it was approached by officials at the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a government panel that scrutinizes deals over national security concerns, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because these details are not public. CFIUS was concerned about how Fosun would operate Ironshore's Wright & Co, a provider of professional liability coverage to U.S. government employees such as law enforcement personnel and national security officials, including the Central Intelligence Agency, according to these sources.   Fosun, Ironshore and CFIUS all declined to comment on the process.  CFIUS operates a voluntary filing system for companies engaged in a deal. Such an instance of the panel approaching companies after they complete a deal is rare.  But the recent U.S. scrutiny of Fosun -- which did not seek CFIUS approval for the Ironshore deal -- is just one example of a new impetus by CFIUS to target what it refers to as \"non-notified transactions\" -- or deals that did not seek CFIUS approval in advance. In the last twelve months CFIUS has stepped up its pursuit of these non-filers over concerns that some deals were falling through the cracks, according to sources with direct knowledge of the panel's inner workings. This previously unreported push by CFIUS has the potential to delay some deals and raises the risk of them being thwarted altogether.  While Wright accounted for a tiny fraction of Ironshore's business, the inquiry has forced Fosun to delay its initial public offering of Ironshore, which has been registered with  the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission since June, until CFIUS clears the original acquisition. Fosun will now likely miss a window for IPOs due to the expected market volatility around the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election, according to the sources. Chinese companies have been treated with suspicion by CFIUS because of the ties many of them have to the country's communist regime, reflecting the complicated diplomatic and commercial ties between China and the United States. This has not stopped Premier Li Keqiang's \"going out\" policy, which encourages Chinese companies to buy foreign trophy assets. The push -- aided by CFIUS's history of rarely shooting down deals altogether -- contributed to Chinese M&A activity in the United States reaching a record high of $32 billion so far this year. To be sure, CFIUS has approached companies in the past as well, and does not limit its review to only Chinese deals. In 2010, CFIUS contacted Russian internet company CMail.ru and AOL Inc over the latter's $188 million divestment of messaging service ICQ to Cmail.ru, which had already been completed. The CFIUS review in that instance did not require the deal to be unraveled. On rare occasions, the panel has also vetoed deals, such as the $3.3 billion sale of Koninklijke Philips NV's (PHG.AS) lighting business to a consortium of Chinese investors, which it blocked last January. But Ironshore and similar cases this year show that the U.S. watchdog is flexing its muscles in a more subtle, albeit disruptive, fashion.  \"Companies may assume that there is no chance that CFIUS would have an interest in their transaction, but that runs the risk of possible miscalculation,\" said Eric Dinallo, a partner at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton LLP.   RISING SCRUTINY CFIUS, an agency made up of eight U.S. government departments and chaired by the Treasury Secretary, does not publicize the reasons for its decisions. The majority of transactions involve private companies with no SEC filings. Recent regulatory filings and statements by publicly listed companies, however, offer glimpses of CFIUS catching some companies off guard. U.S. electronics distributor Ingram Micro Inc (IM.N) said in July it would seek CFIUS approval for its acquisition by Chinese shipping company Tianjin Tianhai Investment, despite saying in February it did not need to, following \"consultation\" with CFIUS.  As a result, in August Ingram Micro pushed back the deadline for the deal with Tianjin to close by three months to Nov. 13. CFIUS is interested in learning more about the company's supply of technology to the U.S. government, according to the sources. Ingram Micro and Tianjin Tianhai declined to comment. CFIUS has added staff and resources in the last two years to identify non-notified transactions, the sources said, though the number of additional people recruited or the extra funding it was given could not be learned.      Among the CFIUS staffers playing a role in identifying non-filers, alongside CFIUS Staff Chairman Stephen Hanson and Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary for Investment Security Aimen Mir, is Brian Reissaus, a former member of the Defense Security Service, an agency of the U.S. Department of Defense, according to the sources. Reissaus will often be the CFIUS staffer reaching out to companies, the sources said. A Treasury spokesman declined to comment on behalf of CFIUS and the staffers. Chinese government officials declined to comment on CFIUS's new focus. CAUGHT OFF-GUARD CFIUS's crackdown on these non-notified transactions shows how the agency's focus has expanded beyond traditional sectors of national security concern, such as aerospace and semiconductors, to less obvious areas ranging from commercial IT and agriculture to biomedical science and electronics.   Companies whose deals are reviewed by CFIUS without having made voluntary filings risk delays in completing them and uncertainty over their investment plans, lawyers say. In the case of Fosun, to ensure CFIUS approval Ironshore agreed to sell Wright last month to former American International Group Inc (AIG.N) CEO Hank Greenberg's Starr Companies, according to the sources. In light of this divestment and other conversations it had with CFIUS, the company has reset the CFIUS review process by making another filing with the panel, and an outcome is expected in the coming weeks, one of the sources added. In the interim, Fosun has been exploring selling Ironshore outright as an alternative to an IPO, according to the sources.  HELL OR HIGH WATER Some companies resist filing for a CFIUS review voluntarily because they fear that addressing this issue during their tough merger negotiations will add an extra layer of complexity to the talks, and some times risk complicating them to the point that a deal is not reached.   This is because, once the possibility of a CFIUS review is foreseen in a merger contract, companies have to haggle over who assumes the financial risk under various scenarios. Sellers try to push for \"hell-or-high-water\" provisions in contracts requiring the buyers to do whatever it takes in terms of divestitures and other measures to obtain CFIUS approval. Buyers resist this and seek to negotiate in advance what CFIUS remedies would be acceptable to them.  A case in point is Zhongwang USA LLC, which is backed by Chinese aluminum magnate Liu Zhongtian, and its $2.33 billion deal last month to acquire U.S. aluminum company Aleris Corp (ALSD.PK). Zhongwang USA agreed to \"undertake best efforts to obtain CFIUS clearance as soon as practicable,\" while also limiting any CFIUS-related divestitures it would be willing to accept to 5 percent of Aleris' 2015 U.S. net sales, a regulatory filing shows. The heightened scrutiny is also jacking up CFIUS-related breakup fees that buyers have to agree to in order to get a deal done, with sellers often asking these to be deposited in escrow accounts for more security. In the case of Zhongwang, it placed its $100 million breakup fee in an escrow account when it signed its deal with Aleris.  Taken together, CFIUS lawyers and other consultants are advising their clients to proactively file with the agency to get out in front of the scrutiny. \"Go to CFIUS before you close a transaction,\" said Dinallo. \"Our experience has been that, if there is no issue, CFIUS has been quick to respond.\"  For a graphic of CFIUS cases over the years click here For a graphic of how China has accelerated purchases of U.S. companies click here  "

While there is no certainty that CBS and Viacom will agree to a merger, Moonves is seeking to capitalize on his 10-year track record at the helm of CBS to gain as much influence as possible over the combined company, the people said on Monday. The 67-year-old media executive is deliberating his options with advice from famed Wall Street lawyer Martin Lipton, the people said. Lipton's law firm, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, has been a long-time advisor of CBS.  Negotiations between Moonves and National Amusements Inc (NAI), through which the Redstones own an 80 percent stake of CBS and Viacom, have not started in earnest, and the exact terms that he will be asking for are not clear, the people said. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is not public. A CBS spokesman declined to comment. National Amusements and Lipton did not return calls for comment.  Moonves would not be the first CEO of a media company controlled by the Redstones to seek such assurances for autonomy. Viacom's former CEO Philippe Dauman was on the board of National Amusements as well as a member of the seven-person trust that takes over Sumner Redstone's stake in National Amusements after he dies or is declared incapacitated.  But after Redstone removed Dauman from NAI's board and the trust in May, the executive stepped down in August following a legal battle. He received over $70 million under the agreement. Similarly, when CBS merged with Viacom in 2000, the company's bylaws gave Mel Karmazin, who was president and chief operating officer of the combined company reporting to Redstone, full operating control.  Also, Karmazin had a stipulation in his contract that Redstone needed three-quarters of the board's approval to fire him. Karmazin resigned in 2004 over differences with Redstone. POSSIBLE MERGER  Sumner Redstone's daughter, Shari Redstone, has been in favor of recombining the two companies for some time under the leadership of Moonves, sources have told Reuters. A spokeswoman for Shari Redstone said she declined to comment. Both CBS and Viacom have formed independent board committees to consider a merger at the behest of NAI, and whether terms of a merger can be agreed is now up to them. NAI has said it will not support any other transaction, nor will it give up its controlling interest.  In public comments, Moonves has been lukewarm to the idea of combining the two back together again. Viacom, which owns Comedy Central, MTV and film studio Paramount, has been struggling to turn around its declining ratings and ad revenue. \"We are never going to do something that is bad for CBS shareholders,\" Moonves said at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch investor conference last month when asked about a potential tie-up. But combining CBS and Viacom could help both companies better compete with a massive increase in online programming that has shaken traditional business models, and to secure improved terms from bigger-than-ever pay TV operators that remain the dominant distributors of programming, Wall Street investors and analysts have suggested.

    "text": "Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N) is still deliberating whether it should make an offer for Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) in the face of resistance from Salesforce shareholders over the strategic merits and valuation of such a deal, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. Twitter shares have lost as much as a third of their value since Oct. 5 on concerns the company has attracted less interest from potential acquirers than previously envisaged. It now has a market capitalization of $12 billion. Salesforce is deliberating whether it is worth making a lowball offer for Twitter in the coming days based on Twitter's stock performance and any news of other bidders, the people said. Other potential acquirers such as Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O) and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) have backed away from making offers for the Internet company, the people said. There may however be other companies contemplating offers for Twitter whose identity has not yet been reported, some of the sources suggested. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Salesforce declined to comment while Twitter, Google and Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters previously reported that Twitter aimed to conclude deliberations about selling itself by Oct. 27, when it reports its third-quarter earnings. Salesforce.com, run by CEO Marc Benioff, is focused on cloud-based sales and marketing software. Unlike Twitter, its main product is aimed at business users, not consumers. Under Salesforce.com, Twitter could become a corporate tool used to power sentiment analysis and nurture customer relationships. A potential acquisition of Twitter has weighed down Salesforce's stock since news broke on Sept. 23 that it was vying for Twitter. Its shares rose as much as 7 percent on Monday after a weekend report by Bloomberg News suggested Salesforce was unlikely to make an offer. Some analysts and investors have questioned why Salesforce would need to own Twitter, when it already licenses the Twitter \"firehose\" for its new artificial intelligence platform, Einstein. At Salesforce's annual client conference last week, Benioff said Salesforce considers buying many companies but maintains discipline, and wished Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey \"well.\" These comments tamped out expectations that Salesforce would be an aggressive bidder for Twitter.  Since its founding a decade ago, Twitter has struggled to generate revenue growth and profit, despite having some 313 million average monthly active users and a growing presence as a source of news.

    "text": "TORONTO Canadian online gambling company Amaya Inc (AYA.TO) (AYA.O) and British bookmaker William Hill Plc (WMH.L) said they were in talks to combine in a merger of equals, confirming a Reuters report about the discussions earlier on Friday. The all-share merger would be \"consistent with the strategic objectives\" of both companies, they said in a joint statement. Amaya has received strong buyout interest from other companies in the industry and some private equity firms, two sources familiar with the situation said. The statement did not mention GVC Holdings Plc (GVC.L), a sports betting and gaming company based in the Isle of Man which the sources had also cited as a suitor. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. GVC did not respond to a request for comment. The sources also said that former Amaya Chief Executive David Baazov, subject of an insider trading investigation from Quebec's securities regulator, had abandoned plans to bid for the company. Amaya said in February it had received a nonbinding proposal from Baazov to take the company private, but the formal bid never came. The bids for the operator of online gambling website PokerStars were above Baazov's planned offer price of C$21 per share, the sources said. Amaya's stock jumped on the Reuters report and trading was halted within minutes, at C$23.41, up 9.1 percent on the day, in Toronto. The level was the highest in about 11 months. The company had a market capitalization of about C$3.1 billion ($2.34 billion) before the rally. Baazov had prepared a bid but waited to sort out issues with the securities regulator before submitting it, the sources said. He was mulling a bid as recently as the summer, they said. Baazov resigned as CEO in August and was replaced by Rafi Ashkenazi. William Hill, itself a subject of an approach from 888 Holdings (888.L) and Rank Group (RNK.L), rejected a revised takeover bid from the two rivals in August. Amaya paid $4.9 billion to acquire the owner and operator of the PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker brands in 2014, saying at the time that the deal created the largest publicly traded online gaming company.  The company's biggest revenue contributions are from the Isle of Man and Malta, while it has also expanded into France, Italy, Spain and Britain, and expects to soon gain regulatory approval to operate in the Czech Republic and the Netherlands. It sees its biggest growth opportunity in the United States.  After a lengthy approval process, Amaya won permission to operate PokerStars in New Jersey, one of the first U.S. states to legalize the business. The company last year limited the operations of its StarsDraft fantasy sports business in most U.S. states as a string of jurisdictions grapple with whether the fast-growing, multibillion-dollar industry constitutes illegal gambling. Contests such as StarsDraft, in which players draft fantasy teams for sports including football, basketball and baseball, have drawn increased scrutiny from regulators since last year. "

If the Goldman consortium bid for SVG's entire investment portfolio prevails, shareholders would be able to sell stock at 680 pence each in a series of tenders over the coming months and the firm would be wound up in the second quarter next year. Boston-based firm HarbourVest launched its SVG bid on Sept. 12 at 650 pence a share, saying it was taking advantage of a weaker pound, following the Brexit vote, to snap up assets with good short-term growth prospects. SVG shares closed 0.45 percent lower at 667.50 pence. \"We believe it is the most favorable offer for SVG Capital shareholders after considering the additional risks and timing involved,\" Liberum analysts wrote in a note for clients.  HarbourVest said late on Wednesday that Aviva Investors (AV.L) and Legal & General Investment Management (LGEN.L), which together own about 7.3 percent of SVG's shares, had both withdrawn letters of intent to vote for its offer.  Investors have been frustrated for years by Britain's listed private equity sector because it has traded at a discount to the value of its assets, prompting some activist investors to step in. SVG rejected HarbourVest's hostile approach last month saying it was taking to other suitors who might offer a better price.  On Tuesday, SVG said it had agreed to sell half its portfolio to Pomona Capital and Pantheon Ventures but this was then trumped the same day by the Goldman consortium offer. SVG said the new bid was equivalent to a 6.8 percent discount to the value of its investment portfolio at the end of July, better than the 11.5 percent discount offered by HarbourVest. SVG said Goldman Sachs and the Canadian pension plan would pay about 748 million pounds ($950 million) for its investment portfolio which would allow it to return 1.06 billion pounds to shareholders once net cash was included.

    "text": "SINGAPORE Singapore-listed commodities trader Noble Group agreed to sell its North American energy distribution unit to U.S. firm Calpine Corp for $1.05 billion, moving a step closer to  completing a restructuring to raise $2 billion to help cut debt. The sale of Noble Americas Energy Solutions (NAES) includes repayment of working capital of about $248 million, Noble said in a statement. Noble's shares rose nearly 7 percent in early trading on Monday. The move comes as the Hong Kong-based trader aims to rebuild investor confidence after a brutal commodities downturn coincided with a questioning of its accounts in early 2015 by Iceberg Research, sparking a collapse in its share price and ratings credit agency downgrades. \"The sale will reduce investors' concerns about Noble's liquidity and balance sheet,\" said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, analyst at Religare Capital Markets. He said the company's strategy of getting out of asset-heavy businesses rather than chase \"overpriced assets\" was a positive as it would help it focus on its core operations. Noble said it expects the NAES transaction to close in December 2016. Noble's net debt rose to $3.92 billion in April-June from $3.69 billion a year ago.  \"The sale of NAES substantially completes the $2 billion capital raising initiative that we announced in June\", Nobles' Co-Chief Executive Officers Jeff Frase and Will Randall said in its statement. \"With this divestiture, Noble will continue to reduce debt while also funding growth opportunities in our high-return businesses.\"  Completing a plan to cut debt could help restore stability at Noble after many months of turbulence. Noble's former CEO Yusuf Alireza, a former Goldman Sachs Asia co-head, quit unexpectedly in late May after helping Noble secure $3 billion in credit facilities and within days, the company announced a $500 million cash call. The firm's founder and chairman Richard Elman also said in June he would step down within 12 months. Elman grew Noble into one of the world's biggest traders of commodities in a bull run since setting up the group in 1986. Meanwhile, Calpine, which generates electricity from natural gas and geothermal resources, said in a statement the NAES purchase price was $800 million plus an estimated $100 million of net working capital.

Dongbei, owned by the Liaoning provincial government in the country's \"rustbelt\" northeast, has been at the heart of troubles in China's debt market this year, defaulting on nine separate bonds even as Beijing has vowed to crack down on \"zombie\" firms with perennial losses and too much debt. Its first bond default in late March helped trigger a sharp sell-off in the corporate debt markets as investors reassessed the likelihood of bailouts for key provincially-owned state enterprises, especially in coal and steel sectors hobbled by overcapacity.    The firm has also been involved in an extended struggle with creditors over how to restructure its debt, highlighting the challenges in restructuring inefficient, state-owned enterprises, according to Reuters IFR and other media publications.  Dongbei's listed subsidiary Fushun Special Steel had previously said on Sept. 30 that a Chinese court was reviewing an application for such a bankruptcy restructuring.  In a separate exchange filing on Monday, Fushun said that 496.9 million of its shares held by Dongbei had been frozen by the court. The filing by creditor Alashan Jinzhen Smelting Co Ltd includes Dongbei subsidiaries Dalian Special Steel Co Ltd and Dalian Gaohe Jinbang Xiancun Co Ltd, Xinhua said. In its exchange filing, Fushun said it had not been named in the filing. A court-managed bankruptcy process will not necessarily end in liquidation, but analysts said the recent court-ordered liquidation of Guangxi Nonferrous Metal Group, another provincially-owned enterprise, sets a worrying precedent.

The sale of BC Iron's stake in the Nullagine mine potentially boosts Fortescue's annual capacity by around 6 million tonnes, although the company gave no time line for resuming operations at the mine. Nullagine was closed earlier this year because the cost of producing and shipping the ore for BC Iron exceeded selling prices, however it may still be economic for Fortescue which owns the rail line and port used to ship the ore. \"I'm pretty sure they'll just bring the tonnes back on line and put it through their system, given that they've certainly got port and rail capacity to do 180 million tonnes (a year),\" said an analyst, who declined to be named as he hadn't read all the details of the deal. For BC Iron, the sale clears the asset off its books, allowing it to concentrate on exploiting another Australian iron ore mine called Iron Valley. BC Iron initially sold 50 percent of the mine to Fortescue in 2009, which in return provided use of its infrastructure to enable the iron ore to be shipped and sold to markets in China. Fortescue then sold half its interest to BC Iron for A$190 million in December 2012, when iron ore was selling for around $123 a tonne, more than twice the current price. .IO62-CNI=SI  \"We cannot say categorically when Nullagine might be restarted,\" a Fortescue spokesman said. \"There are several variables, not least of which is the price of iron.\" Fortescue, which is scheduled to release its September quarter production data on Oct. 20 has previously set an iron ore production target of 165-170 million tonnes in the year ending June 30, 2017. Fortescue said it will pay BC Iron a royalty from any future sales which could be withheld up to A$7.5 million to offset rehabilitation costs and other obligations. "

Kidman bidders Hunan Dakang Pasture Farming Co Ltd (Dakang) and Australian Rural Capital Ltd (ARC) have decided not to launch a counter offer and are expected to follow DomaCom's exit from the bidding, a source at the Hunan and ARC consortium told Reuters. The decisions remove potential rivals to an A$365 million  ($277 million) joint bid announced on Sunday for the politically-sensitive asset lodged by Australia's richest woman, miner Gina Rinehart, and Chinese developer Shanghai CRED. The sale of the large rural cattle-ranching holding - about the same size as South Korea - has sparked heated debate over whether key Australian agriculture land and assets should be sold to foreign interests.    In April, the Australian government rejected an offer by a consortium headed by Shanghai CRED, Hunan Dakang and a minority 20 percent Australian interest, the group's second rejection in six months. Naoumidis said it would be too difficult for Domacom to compete with the Rinehart-led offer. \"We are winding up our Kidman campaign,\" Naoumidis said. \"It's not just majority Australian; it's Rinehart. She’s politically connected.\" The Rinehart-Shanghai CRED deal requires regulatory approval, but that consortium's offer - consisting of two-thirds to be owned by the Rinehart-led Hancock Prospecting and one-third by Shanghai CRED - satisfies the government's preference for S. Kidman to remain at least majority Australian owned.    "

Sydney-listed CIMIC, mostly owned by Spanish-owned German company Hochtief AG (HOTG.DE), said it will offer A$3.15 per share for UGL, a 47 percent premium to its last close, but still less than half its A$7-plus levels in 2012 before the impact of a commodity downturn. \"CIMIC believes UGL's competencies are complementary to CIMIC's existing operations or enhance CIMIC's capabilities in new activities,\" CIMIC, formerly known as Leighton Holdings, said in a statement. UGL said in a statement that it would convene a board meeting to consider the offer and urged shareholders not to take any action in the meantime. It added that CIMIC had bought 14 percent of its shares. The offer, a far cry from the target company's A$1.2 billion market capitalization four years earlier, highlights the impact on the engineering sector of a downturn in mining due to weak commodity prices. In June, UGL warned that delays at a large oil and gas project would hit profits, sending its shares down by a third in one day. Following Monday's takeover offer announcement, UGL shares jumped 48 percent, their biggest one-day gain since listing, to be trading at A$3.17, just ahead of the offer price. The broader market was up 0.3 percent. UGL in August posted its second consecutive yearly loss, a A$106 million net loss compared to a loss of A$303 million the previous year, and said a restructure would see the company return to profitability.

    "text": "SYDNEY Australia's richest woman Gina Rinehart and Chinese developer Shanghai CRED have agreed on a deal to jointly purchase S. Kidman & Co, the country's largest private land holding, for A$365 million ($276.8 million), the companies said on Sunday.  Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting will own 67 percent and Shanghai CRED 33 percent of Australian Outback Beef Pty Ltd, a new joint venture created to buy Kidman in a bid to overcome government concerns about foreign interests buying the cattle empire. In April, the Australian government rejected a A$371 million  ($281.3 million) bid by a consortium headed by Shanghai CRED and Hunan Dakang Pasture Farming Co Ltd (002505.SZ), alongside a minority 20 percent Australian interest, the group's second rejection in six months. Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison said the sale of Kidman's vast holdings - about the same size as South Korea - to the Chinese buyers was not in the national interest. Domestic ownership of agriculture is seen as crucial for Australia to cash in on global food demand and to keep tax revenues onshore. Rinehart, who has close ties with ruling conservative lawmakers, said Kidman \"is an important part of Australia's pioneering and entrepreneurial history\". Founded more than 100 years ago, Kidman has an average beef herd carrying capacity of 185,000 cattle and pastoral leases covering 101,000 sq km (39,000 sq miles). The company has already agreed to sell its Anna Creek Station in South Australia, which makes up a quarter of its land holding, to an Australian buyer to help assuage government concerns. Anna Creek is adjacent to the Woomera weapons testing site, a concern noted by Morrison in rejecting the sale. The Hancock deal is reliant on the separate sale of Anna Creek being completed. Proceeds from the sale of that and another station will be paid to Kidman and retained in the company for the benefit of Australian Outback Beef. “We welcome the significant investment proposed in addition to the purchase price and are confident that the Kidman business will be in good hands,' Kidman Chairman John Crosby said. A source familiar with the Dakang bid told Reuters in late August that it was considering a fresh bid of its own with potential domestic investors. Rinehart would be a formidable opponent if Dakang pushed ahead. She is Australia's richest woman with assets worth $11.1 billion, according to Forbes, largely tied to iron ore assets. In August, she named former lawmaker Sophia Mirabella to a senior role at Hancock Prospecting. She is also close to Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce.  ($1 = 1.3187 Australian dollars) "

Kebonang said the government could not afford the cost of about 7.6 billion pula ($713 million) needed to keep the state-owned firm running. \"A decline in the quality of copper over the years, which was made worse by the recent slump in commodity prices, has made the burden of keeping the mine operational unbearable,\" Kebonang told Reuters.  \"Pumping such kind of money into the mine would mean we suspend other government commitments such as providing Anti-retroviral drugs and educational funding.\"  Kebonang said the government has applied to the high court to place the mine under provisional liquidation and will continue to pay the salaries of 5,000 workers, none of whom have lost their jobs yet. \"The liquidator is the one who will make a decision to either shut it down or restructure the operations such as closing down some shafts that are now too expensive to mine and retrench part of the staff,\" Kebonang said. Copper gained more than five percent in September, its best monthly showing since February 2015, as the industrial metal played catch-up with other base metals after largely underperforming for most of the year amid expectations of rising supply. Copper mines in the world's biggest diamond producer, Botswana, have been struggling in the past two years with two others, African Copper's Mowana Mine and Discovery Metals, liquidated in 2015. BCL mine incurred a 1.2 billion pula loss in operating costs in 2015 due to a slump in commodity prices.

    "text": "SAO PAULO Itaú Unibanco Holding SA agreed on Saturday to pay 710 million reais ($220 million) for the retail banking assets of Citigroup Inc (C.N) in Brazil, further cementing the leadership of Latin America's No. 1 bank by market value among wealthy clients in the country. In a securities filing, Itaú (ITUB4.SA) said the deal included 100 percent of Banco Citibank SA's retail banking and insurance assets, and Citigroup's stakes in automated teller machine operator TecBan Tecnologia Bancaria SA and Cia Brasileira de Securitização SA, a consumer structured finance firm. The transaction requires regulatory approval, the filing said. According to the filing, the transaction will also involve the restructuring of some unnamed Banco Citibank units that will be eventually spun off and integrated into Itaú's platform. Citigroup struggled in Brazil as local lenders gobbled up market share over the past decade and now control 90 percent of the country's banking assets. For lenders like Itaú, tapping wealthy retail banking clients is key as they seek to increase the share of fee-related income and money management activities on profit. Two people with knowledge of the deal told Reuters recently that Itaú could pay as much as $300 million for the money-losing unit. The people said Itaú trumped Banco Santander Brasil SA (SANB11.SA) in the race for Banco Citibank, whose parent is also in the process of exiting Argentina and Colombia. Press representatives for Itaú, Santander Brasil and Citigroup could not be immediately reached for comment. Citigroup had previously announced that it will maintain a corporate and investment banking unit in the country. Citigroup struggled in Brazil as Itaú and large local rivals gobbled up market share over the past decade - currently, six banks control 90 percent of the country's banking assets. For Itaú, tapping wealthy retail banking clients is key to enhancing the share of fee-related income on profit. According to the filing, the acquisition of Banco Citibank and the 5.64 percent and 3.6 percent stakes in TecBan and Cibrasec, respectively, will not impact financial results this year. The deal allows Itaú to increase assets to 1.404 trillion reais, making it Brazil's second-largest lender. Minimum capital regulatory ratio readings at Itaú will fall by 0.4 percentage points, the filing said. Banco Citibank has about 71 branches across some of Brazil's largest cities, 315,000 clients and 35 billion reais in deposits and assets under management. The U.S. bank, built with a series of acquisitions dating back to the 1980s, has been trying to slim down since the financial crisis to be as profitable as its rivals. Citigroup Chief Executive Officer Michael Corbat counted at least 21 markets with exceptionally low returns on assets and substandard operating efficiency as candidates for restructuring. Citigroup has had to resort to aggressive cost controls as near-zero interest rates, a slump in oil prices and slowing global growth have hurt business. ($1 = 3.2210 reais) "

A letter filed with the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals by a lawyer for Nortel requested an additional 30 days to continue settlement talks over the funds. Former Nortel business units in Canada, the United States and Europe have been pushing differing proposals for splitting the money. The funds came from the sale of Ontario-based Nortel's global businesses, including patents sold in 2011 for $4.5 billion to a group of technology firms led by Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Sony Corp (6758.T).  The proceeds triggered one of the most expensive and complex cross-border legal battles in history. Fees for lawyers and advisers paid out of the Nortel estate have topped $1.9 billion, according to Diane Urquhart, a financial analyst who compiles the data from court records. Nortel was among the world's most valuable companies during the 1990s' Internet bubble, but it fell into bankruptcy in 2009 and into liquidation. An agreement would clear the way for pensioners and bondholders to get paid after a seven-year wait. "

    "text": "TORONTO Canadian online gambling company Amaya Inc (AYA.TO) (AYA.O) and British bookmaker William Hill Plc (WMH.L) said they were in talks to combine in a merger of equals, confirming a Reuters report about the discussions earlier on Friday. The all-share merger would be \"consistent with the strategic objectives\" of both companies, they said in a joint statement. Amaya has received strong buyout interest from other companies in the industry and some private equity firms, two sources familiar with the situation said. The statement did not mention GVC Holdings Plc (GVC.L), a sports betting and gaming company based in the Isle of Man which the sources had also cited as a suitor. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. GVC did not respond to a request for comment. The sources also said that former Amaya Chief Executive David Baazov, subject of an insider trading investigation from Quebec's securities regulator, had abandoned plans to bid for the company. Amaya said in February it had received a nonbinding proposal from Baazov to take the company private, but the formal bid never came. The bids for the operator of online gambling website PokerStars were above Baazov's planned offer price of C$21 per share, the sources said. Amaya's stock jumped on the Reuters report and trading was halted within minutes, at C$23.41, up 9.1 percent on the day, in Toronto. The level was the highest in about 11 months. The company had a market capitalization of about C$3.1 billion ($2.34 billion) before the rally. Baazov had prepared a bid but waited to sort out issues with the securities regulator before submitting it, the sources said. He was mulling a bid as recently as the summer, they said. Baazov resigned as CEO in August and was replaced by Rafi Ashkenazi. William Hill, itself a subject of an approach from 888 Holdings (888.L) and Rank Group (RNK.L), rejected a revised takeover bid from the two rivals in August. Amaya paid $4.9 billion to acquire the owner and operator of the PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker brands in 2014, saying at the time that the deal created the largest publicly traded online gaming company.  The company's biggest revenue contributions are from the Isle of Man and Malta, while it has also expanded into France, Italy, Spain and Britain, and expects to soon gain regulatory approval to operate in the Czech Republic and the Netherlands. It sees its biggest growth opportunity in the United States.  After a lengthy approval process, Amaya won permission to operate PokerStars in New Jersey, one of the first U.S. states to legalize the business. The company last year limited the operations of its StarsDraft fantasy sports business in most U.S. states as a string of jurisdictions grapple with whether the fast-growing, multibillion-dollar industry constitutes illegal gambling. Contests such as StarsDraft, in which players draft fantasy teams for sports including football, basketball and baseball, have drawn increased scrutiny from regulators since last year. "

    "text": "LONDON UniCredit (CRDI.MI) is holding informal talks with several banks to gauge interest in online broker FinecoBank (FBK.MI), hoping the Milan-listed business will be valued at no less than 2.5 billion euros ($2.8 billion), two sources said on Friday. Italy's largest bank, which is conducting a wide-ranging review of its global network, owns 55.4 percent of FinecoBank which has a total market value of close to 3.1 billion euros. But this is seen as artificially high by bankers and analysts because the broker benefits from a favorable accounting and regulatory treatment of holdings of UniCredit bonds, which ICBPI analysts say account for 80 percent of its total assets. A sale of FinecoBank would help UniCredit strengthen its capital and reduce the need for a share issue for new chief executive Jean-Pierre Mustier who is due to unveil a strategic and capital-boosting plan on Dec. 13. Mustier wants to have a clear idea of how much he can raise from asset sales before pressing ahead with a share offer and the bank has invited a small number of Italian and international lenders to come forward with potential offers, the sources said. VALUATION GAP Those banks approached included Banca Generali (BGN.MI), Intesa SanPaolo (ISP.MI) and BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), although the  parties remain far apart on price, with initial tentative offers valuing the business at about 2 billion euros, one source said. However, an Intesa Sanpaolo spokesman said it was not interested in FinecoBank, while officials at UniCredit, Banca Generali and BNP Paribas declined to comment. There is no certainty of a deal, the sources said, cautioning that UniCredit is keen to maximize the value of its assets as it seeks to plug a gap in its capital estimated to be as big as 8 billion euros. Assicurazioni Generali (GASI.MI), which controls Banca Generali is cautious about mergers and acquisitions (M&A) deals, one of the sources said, with little shareholder appetite for big-ticket transactions. Managing director Gian Maria Mossa told an Italian newspaper that Banca Generali had no acquisition plans. Analysts see a significant hurdle to a sale of FinecoBank because roughly half of its revenue comes from 9 billion euros in bonds it bought from UniCredit. These are not risk weighted because UniCredit controls FinecoBank, and so do not count towards its regulatory leverage or risk concentration measures, analysts said, adding this would change under a new owner, potentially hitting the broker's valuation.

    "text": "DOHA/FRANKFURT Deutsche Bank has secured backing from its largest investor and is seeking advice from other banks as it scrambles to restore market confidence undermined by a demand by U.S. authorities for up to $14 billion over mis-selling allegations. Qatari investors who own the largest stake in Germany's largest bank do not plan to sell their shares and could consider buying more if it decides to raise capital, sources familiar with Qatari investment policy told Reuters. \"Purchasing more (Deutsche Bank) stock - that could be considered ... which is not to say there are any imminent plans to do that,\" said a source close to the Qatari investors who own just below 10 percent in Deutsche Bank. The source declined to be identified as the matter is confidential. If a capital hike does turn out to be required, the Qatari investors would probably take part in it as they want to keep their roughly 10 percent stake, a second source close to the matter added. Deutsche shares plunged to record intra-day lows below 10 euros last week on Friday and although they have since rebounded to just above 12 euros, they are 13 percent below last month's peak and 46 percent below their close at the end of last year. That implies the Qataris may have lost, on paper, over $1.2 billion on their investments in the bank. German weekly Der Spiegel reported, without citing sources, that Qatari investors around Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani, with backing from sovereign wealth funds, were mulling taking a 25 percent in the lender, sending Deutsche Bank's U.S.-listed shares higher. But sources familiar with the situation told Reuters it was unlikely that the Qataris would acquire a stake as big as 25 percent. Deutsche Bank declined to comment and Sheikh Hamad was not immediately available for comment. HIGH LEVEL TALKS     Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan, who is attending the International Monetary Fund and World Bank's autumn meetings in Washington, is due to meet with the Department of Justice as well as with senior managers of other investment banks in the United States to discuss the lender's options, people familiar with his schedule said.  However, the talks with other bankers are expected to focus on immediate steps the German bank may be able to take such as asset sales, rather than asking shareholders for fresh cash.  \"The cap hike issue will unlikely be the focus of most of those meetings,\" one of those people said, adding that pulling off a capital-raising would be a well-rehearsed exercise which does not need too much advance discussion.  Deutsche Bank declined to comment on Cryan's discussions. Separately, German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said that while Deutsche Bank faced enormous challenges with potential fines in the United States, moves by its leadership to change the bank's business model showed it was reacting to the risks. Gabriel said the government did not have its own risk assessment for the bank, but that Germany was keen to see the 146-year-old bank succeed in the longer term. \"It's completely obvious that we have an interest in Deutsche Bank again becoming a stable financial institution that is successful nationally and internationally,\" Gabriel said.    Germany's largest bank is under heavy pressure as it fights the penalty that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) plans to impose for mis-stating the risks of securities the bank sold ahead of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. This sent its shares to a record low last week and spooked clients. Deutsche Bank's proposed fine has emerged as another bone of contention between the United States and the European Union after the EU said earlier this year that U.S. tech giant Apple Inc owed $14 billion in taxes. The chairman of euro zone finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, told Reuters that the fine was disproportionate and could place Europe's financial system at risk. \"Here is a financial institution which needs to be restructured and strengthened and needs to bring in new capital and we cannot then have an even bigger amount of capital being pulled out by the American authorities. That is really counterproductive, to put it mildly,\" he said. SMALLER FINE IN STORE   Deutsche says it expects to settle with the DOJ for far less than $14 billion, in line with other big banks that negotiated over similar allegations. IMF chief Christine Lagarde gave it some tough advice on Thursday, saying it needed to reform its business model and rapidly reach a deal with U.S. regulators. Deutsche is cutting back a workforce of around 100,000, revamping information technology and shrinking non-core assets. Unlike some European peers, it is sticking with investment banking, with a global reach that the IMF says makes it among the riskiest of all banks. CAP HIKE Launching a capital increase before a settlement with U.S. authorities is seen as unlikely as few investors will be willing to buy shares without being able to gauge the impact on the lender's capital, equity capital markets bankers said. \"And even when a settlement is eventually reached, Deutsche Bank is likely to wait for its share price to recover before launching a cap hike. Currently it would only be able to raise 4.5-5 billion euros and they may want more,\" one banker said. \"A cap hike could be done in the first half of 2017 at the earliest,\" another banker said.    Deutsche Bank ranked 7th worldwide in global equity capital markets according to Thomson Reuters data. While it has the in-house expertise for a capital increase it will rely on other investment banks. In 2014, 25 helped with its rights issue.   \"At this stage, no bank has gotten any mandate for a cap hike,\" a person close to Deutsche Bank said. Most banks will be called in just days before any deal, which will likely be structured as a fully underwritten rights issue with banks guaranteeing to take on shares to sell on to a mix of investment funds, pension funds and hedge funds. Meanwhile, some of Germany's top industrial companies have revived a decades-old network to discuss taking a direct stake in the bank as a way to help shield it, one executive at a large DAX-listed company has said.

Funds controlled by Qatar's former Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani bought 6.1 percent of Deutsche in mid-2014 and increased their stake to just under 10 percent, including options, in July this year. But Germany's biggest bank has been engulfed by a crisis of confidence since last month after the U.S. Department of Justice demanded up to $14 billion to settle claims that the bank missold U.S. mortgage-backed securities before the financial crisis. It is fighting the fine but may have to turn to investors for more money if it is imposed in full. Deutsche shares plunged to record intra-day lows below 10 euros last week on Friday and although they have since rebounded to just above 12 euros, they are 13 percent below last month's peak and 46 percent below their close at the end of last year. That implies the Qataris may have lost, on paper, over $1.2 billion on their investments in the bank.  However a Qatari source, who is close to Sheikh Hamad's office but stressed that he was not involved in the Qataris' internal discussions about Deutsche, said he expected Sheikh Hamad to stand by the bank. \"Purchasing more stock - that could be considered ... which is not to say there are any imminent plans to do that,\" said the source, declining to be named as the matter is confidential. Officials in Sheikh Hamad's office did not immediately comment, while Deutsche declined to comment. A second source said the Qataris had no intention of selling out. \"This is a long-term investment. Qatar believes it will all work out well for the bank in the end.\" If a capital hike does turn out to be required, \"they would probably take part in it as they want to keep their roughly 10 percent stake. But they want to stay below the 10 percent threshold\" for regulatory reasons, the source added. Any investor owning a stake of more than 10 percent in a listed German company is subject to stricter public disclosure rules.  MANAGEMENT The first source also said that since the U.S. Department of Justice's claim in September, he was not aware of any formal correspondence between Sheikh Hamad's investment vehicles -Paramount Services Holdings and Supreme Universal Holdings - and Deutsche's management. The second source said, however, that Qatar's continued involvement in the bank would be under the condition that it resumed focusing on its daily business and did not lose more market share in key businesses such as investment banking.  \"They are too much focused on legal issues, the whole bank is ruled by lawyers at the moment. This needs to be changed.\"  Lawyer Stefan Simon was nominated to Deutsche's supervisory board in July at the suggestion of the two Qatari investment vehicles. He was placed on the board to keep an eye on the bank's execution of its strategy, the source said. The source added, however, that at the moment there was no pressure from Qatar for any changes in top management at Deutsche. \"Execution is the issue, not strategy.\" Qatar's ruling family and the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), the country's sovereign wealth fund, have suffered a string of paper losses on high-profile portfolio investments in recent years, including a stake in Germany’s Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), which is facing fallout from a damaging emissions scandal. Meanwhile, low energy prices have pressured the economy of Qatar, the world's top liquefied natural gas exporter, causing the government to restrain spending. Nevertheless, there is no sign of serious financial pain in Qatar - the QIA's assets are estimated at $335 billion - and Qatari investors continue to buy assets around the world. In June, QIA agreed to buy a major office building in Singapore for about $2.5 billion. \"Hamad bin Jassim, and Qatar for that matter, enter investments looking way down the road,\" said Syed Bashar, a former economist with Qatar's central bank.

    "text": "FRANKFURT Qatari and allied investors are considering bolstering Deutsche Bank with fresh capital by taking a stake of 25 percent in Germany's biggest lender, Der Spiegel magazine reported on Friday. Der Spiegel, without citing sources, said Qatar's former Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani (HBJ) and Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani were weighing the move with the backing of sovereign wealth funds willing to become long-term investors. Earlier, sources familiar with Qatari investment policy told Reuters the Qatari investors - who currently own just under 10 percent of Deutsche Bank - do not plan to sell their shares and could consider buying more if the embattled German bank decides to raise capital. But two sources familiar with the situation said it was unlikely that they would acquire a stake as big as 25 percent. The German bank's U.S.-listed shares jumped 3.1 percent on the Spiegel report but retreated from session highs following the Reuters sources report and traded 1.1 percent higher by 1648 GMT (1248 EDT). Deutsche Bank declined comment. Sheikh Hamad was not immediately available for comment. Funds controlled by HBJ bought 6.1 percent of Deutsche in mid-2014 and increased their stake to just under 10 percent, including options, in July this year.  "

    "authour": " Reporting By Jan Strupczewski; Editing by Andrea Ricci",
    "text": "WASHINGTON The fine proposed by the United States for Deutsche Bank is too big and undermines financial stability by pulling out capital from an institution that is trying to recapitalize and restructure, the chairman of euro zone finance ministers said. Jeroen Dijsselbloem said on Friday that the bank, one of Europe's largest, was not too big to fail, but dismissed any possibility that it would fail noting it had large liquidity buffers and a high solvency ratio. \"The whole concept of too big to fail is wrong, we need to make sure they don't fail. This is about making sure that every bank has enough capital to be bailed in, in case there are losses to be carried. What the stress tests and supervisors tell us is that the bank is sufficiently capitalized,\" he said. The U.S. wants to fine Deutsche $14 billion for its role in the sub-prime mortgage crisis. \"Let's hope it is an opening bid,\" Dijsselbloem told Reuters in an interview. \"These kinds of fines are completely oversized, they are damaging to financial stability.\" \"Here is a financial institution which needs to be restructured and strengthened and needs to bring in new capital and we cannot then have an even bigger amount of capital being pulled out by the American authorities. That is really counterproductive to put it mildly,\" he said. Deutsche Bank has been struggling to overhaul its business model that is built around trading activities that have become much less lucrative under new regulation brought in since the 2008 financial crisis.     While Deutsche Bank is now much smaller than Wall Street rivals like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, it has significant trading relationships with all of the world's largest finance houses through its 42 trillion euros worth of outstanding derivative positions.  \"It still has some issues that it needs to sort out, but I think it can sort them out,\" Dijsselbloem said. \"They need to continue the process of restructuring, recapitalizing and to redesign their business model.\" \"The balance sheet is complex, the structure of the bank is complex, they need to reduce complexity, bring in new capital and find a new strong business model, and that is going on in a lot of banks in Europe,\" he said. A report by the International Monetary Fund this year identified Deutsche Bank as a bigger potential risk to the wider financial system than any other global bank. "

    "text": "U.S. private equity firm HarbourVest Partners said it had extended its $1.35 billion offer for smaller rival SVG Capital (SVI.L), even after the British firm accepted an offer for its investment portfolio from Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Boston-based HarbourVest said on Friday that an extension provides shareholders with additional time to consider its \"compelling and final\" offer. The acceptance period for HarbourVest's hostile bid was extended to Oct. 13 from Oct. 6, the company said, adding that it had received valid acceptances for 27.7 percent of SVG's shares by Thursday afternoon, 26.6 percent of which were subject to letters of intent. HarbourVest launched its SVG bid on Sept. 12 at 650 pence a share, saying it was taking advantage of a weaker pound, following the Brexit vote, to snap up assets with good short-term growth prospects. On Friday, SVG again urged shareholders to not accept HarbourVest's offer. Investor Old Mutual (OML.L), which signed a non-binding letter of intent earlier to back HarbourVest's offer, withdrew its support in respect of about 8.8 percent of SVG's share capital, HarbourVest said in a statement that followed SVG's announcement. Old Mutual had owned a 9.09 percent stake as at Sept. 13, according to Thomson Reuters data. Old Mutual's move follows similar withdrawals by Aviva Investors (AV.L) and Legal & General Investment Management (LGEN.L), which together own about 7.3 percent of SVG's shares. SVG first rejected HarbourVest's hostile approach last month saying it was talking to other suitors who might offer a better price. SVG recommended shareholders vote in favour of the joint offer by the Goldman consortium at its general meeting, which SVG had earlier said would likely take place in early December. SVG said it would update investors before Oct. 13. If the consortium's bid prevails, SVG's shareholders would be able to sell stock at 680 pence each in a series of tenders over the coming months and the firm would be wound up in the second quarter of next year. Shares in SVG were up 0.15 percent at 668.5 pence at 1253 GMT, while HarbourVest was up 0.3 percent at 1,068 pence. "

    "text": "Avolon Holdings Ltd, part of China's acquisitive HNA Group, said on Thursday it agreed to buy the aircraft leasing business of CIT Group Inc (CIT.N) for $10 billion to create the world's third-largest aircraft leasing company. Avolon said it will pay $10 billion for the $9.4 billion net asset value of CIT Group's leasing unit, representing a premium of 6.7 percent.  CIT Group's shares were up 7.58 percent at $39.16 in extended trading.  The transaction will be funded by a combination of Avolon's cash, new equity contributed by HNA Group-controlled Bohai Leasing Co Ltd (000415.SZ) and debt financing of $8.5 billion.  AerCap Holdings (AER.N) and General Electric Co's (GE.N) GE Capital Aviation Services are the world's leading aircraft lessors. The deal comes after Reuters reported in September that Avolon was nearing a purchase of CIT's aerospace assets, which were also being pursued by China's Ping An Insurance Group's (601318.SS) aircraft leasing arm, and Century Tokyo Leasing (8439.T) - a joint venture partner of CIT. Avolon's deal builds on a series of acquisitions made by Chinese aviation and shipping conglomerate HNA Group in recent years as it bulks up its global presence.  The deal also marks another victory for Hudson Executive Capital, the activist hedge fund founded by two former JPMorgan bankers last year. Hudson held 1.2 million shares of CIT, or around 0.5 percent of the stock, according to the fund’s latest regulatory filing.  According to people familiar with the matter, Hudson was among the investors pressing CIT Group to sell off the aircraft leasing arm. The fund has also pressed the company to shed its rail business and lending operations, sources said. Other recent Hudson victories include France’s Danone agreeing to buy White Wave Foods Co, one of Hudson’s portfolio companies, in July for $10.4 billion. A month earlier Medtronic Inc agreed to buy another Hudson portfolio company, HeartWare International Inc, for $1.1 billion. The latest transaction will double the scale of Avolon, Chief Executive Dómhnal Slattery said. The combined entity will have a fleet of 910 aircraft valued at over $43 billion, Avolon said in a statement on Thursday. CIT Group's aircraft leasing business had total assets of $11.1 billion and liabilities of $1.7 billion as of June 30. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017.  Avolon's financial advisers for the transaction were UBS Investment Bank and Morgan Stanley & Co LLC. Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer acted as its legal advisers. "

The advisory group, including Vietnam's Saigon Securities Inc SSI.HM and VinaCapital Corporate Finance Vietnam, on Wednesday signed a consulting contract with SCIC, the government's investment arm said on its website. Vinamilk has a market value of $9.25 billion having grown 21 times in value since listing a decade ago, Reuters data showed. Its shares have risen 33 percent so far this year on hopes of solid earnings and the previously promised stake sale. Steps to deliver on the government's pledge to sell the fast-growing dairy producer will likely be welcomed by investors tiring of the country's incremental partial-privatisation of state assets, market watchers said. Vietnam Dairy Products JSC, as Vinamilk is formally known, scrapped its 49 percent foreign-ownership cap in July in preparation for the stake sale this year by SCIC, which owns 44.7 percent of the dairy firm. The 9 percent stake is worth $830 million at the current market price. The advisory group will consult on the minimum bidding price, seek potential investors and complete necessary procedures for the stake sale, SCIC said. "

    "text": "FRANKFURT Shares in Innogy (IGY.DE), comprising the healthy assets of struggling power group RWE (RWEG.DE), hovered around the issue price in their stock market debut on Friday in Germany's largest listing in 16 years. The stock started trading at 37.30 euros, above an issue price of 36 euros, but dipped as low as 35.95 euros in early trade. RWE, which still holds three-quarters of Innogy, was down 3.8 percent. Innogy bundles the networks, renewables and retail business of RWE, Germany's second-largest utility. Power generation and energy trading stay with RWE. The IPO is a consequence of years of falling profits at RWE's conventional power generation unit, its core business, which has come under intense pressure from renewables and a steep decline in wholesale prices. This has led investors to dump German utility stocks and slap major discounts on them. Investors are also concerned at the potential costs of storing radioactive waste after the country's last nuclear power plants go offline in 2022. Valued at roughly 20 billion euros ($22.2 billion), or more than twice RWE's current market capitalization, Innogy's IPO reflects this relief, giving investors direct exposure to power and gas networks, regulated assets with steady returns.

Snap Inc, which operates the app that lets users send videos and messages that disappear in seconds, is looking to sell shares as early as late March, the Journal reported. (on.wsj.com/2cVicKG) An IPO valued at $25 billion would be significantly higher than Snapchat's most recent valuation of $17.81 billion, based on a $1.81 billion financing round in May. It would also represent the largest IPO by a technology company since Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) went public in 2014. Snapchat had been talking to investment bankers about an IPO towards the end of this year or early in 2017, technology website The Information reported last month. (bit.ly/2dPvEkh) \"We aren't commenting on rumors or speculation about any financing plans,\" the company said in an emailed statement on Thursday. Reports on Snap Inc's IPO come at a time when shares of technology companies such as Square Inc (SQ.N) and Box Inc (BOX.N) that went public over the last two years are trading below their private market valuation. Snapchat's valuation has grown in the last few years as the company added advertising and sponsored contents to its messaging service. The company has told investors to expect $1 billion in advertising revenue in 2017, according to sources familiar with the matter. The company received $3.1 million in advertising revenue for the first 11 months of 2014, according to financial documents leaked last year.  Snapchat is expected to have 58.6 million users in the United States by the end of 2016 and that number is expected to jump 13.6 percent to 66.6 million by next year, according to research firm eMarketer.

Golfsmith suffered in part because of the decline of the so-called Tiger Woods phenomenon. When the golf superstar's career began to fade, some of the many young fans he attracted to the sport also lost interest. Golfsmith, the world's largest specialty golf retailer, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States and for creditor protection in Canada last month, amid fierce competition from discount retailers Wal Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Golfsmith's owner is OMERS Private Equity Inc, the buyout arm of one of Canada's largest pension funds. Golfsmith, which has 109 stores across the United States, filed for bankruptcy with a plan to find a buyer for its U.S. business, reorganize on a smaller scale or liquidate, according to court documents.  Bids for Golfsmith's U.S. business are due on Oct. 17, and an auction is scheduled for two days later, with the goal of closing a sale before the start of the holiday season, according to court documents. Golfsmith is already shutting down some stores to save money. It is not yet clear if Worldwide Golf is eyeing the entire U.S. business of Golfsmith or individual assets, the people said this week.  There are also financial investors interested in the U.S. business of Golfsmith, one of the people added. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Worldwide Golf did not respond to a request for comment.  A Delaware bankruptcy court judge on Thursday approved the bidding process for the company. \"The court approval today continues to keep us on track in our efforts to restructure Golfsmith and improve its long-term viability,\" a Golfsmith representative said.  For its Canadian business, Golfsmith last month announced a deal to sell its shops, operating under the name Golf Town, to a group led by Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd (FFH.TO) and CI Investments Inc. Worldwide Golf operates golf shops under the names Roger Dunn Golf Shops, Van's Golf Shops, Golfers' Warehouse and others across 19 U.S. states, mostly in the West. Golfsmith merged with Golf Town in 2012 in a bid to grow. That deal, however, left it with too many stores and a debt pile of $195 million when it filed for bankruptcy. "

The IPO came as more baby boomers, the biggest buyers of motorized homes, are retiring and selling their property to travel across the United States in the vehicles.  Camping World said in a statement that it priced 11.4 million shares at $22 apiece, the midpoint of its indicated range of $21 and $23. The retiring large generation of baby boomers, born in 1946-1964, has helped the truck, tractor and trailing industry grow 7.5 percent over the past five years, according to data research organization IBIS World. Millennials, born in 1980 through 2000, are a growing market, as they prefer to spend on experiences and adventure over material goods.

Lemonis, who co-owns Camping World with private equity firm Crestview Partners, will maintain \"substantial control\" over the company through his ownership of ML Acquisition and ML R.V. Group, according to the IPO registration statement.  Camping World generated about $3.3 billion in sales last year, up from $1.5 billion in 2011.

    "text": "Pfizer Inc said on Thursday it would sell its global infusion therapy business to ICU Medical Inc for $1 billion in cash and stock that will give it a major stake in the smaller company. Pfizer had acquired the hospital infusion system business, which has annual sales of about $1.2 billion, through its $15 billion purchase in September 2015 of Hospira, which sells generic hospital products and is developing biosimilars meant to compete with big-selling biotech drugs. But Pfizer said in July it was exploring the possible sale of the infusion products to focus on its core pharmaceuticals business.   \"They're not a strategic fit for Pfizer, which has been looking for a buyer,\" said John Boris, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Pfizer will receive $600 million in cash and nearly $400 million in newly issued shares of ICU Medical, giving it a stake of about 16.6 percent in the company. ICU Medical's shares jumped 14 percent to a 52-week high of $143.59 in late afternoon trading, while Pfizer shares slipped 0.9 percent, in line with declines for the drug sector. Chris Lewis, an analyst at Roth Capital Partners, said the addition of Hospira's infusion pumps and intravenous solutions to ICU Medical's needle-free connectors and other intravenous accessories would create a \"pure play\" infusion therapy company offering a complete set of products. \"ICU has been building a war chest for acquisitions and finally delivered on the M&A front,\" Lewis said. Pfizer spokeswoman Joan Campion said on Thursday the drugmaker had determined that more value could be extracted from the Hospira products \"outside of Pfizer,\" and that Pfizer's stake would allow it to profit from the smaller company's future growth. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017, the companies said. POTENTIAL DIVESTMENT Pfizer's purchase of Hospira had been seen by Wall Street analysts as a way of bolstering Pfizer's generic drugs ahead of potentially divesting them. But the largest U.S. drugmaker said last week, after several years of analysis, it had decided not to split, instead holding on to its low-growth generics business because splitting it from Pfizer's patent-protected products would not boost cash flow or better position the businesses competitively. The biggest part of Hospira's business is sterile injectables, such as antibiotics and pain medicines preloaded into syringes. Combined with such products already owned by Pfizer, they generate annual sales of about $6 billion.  ICU also makes devices and supplies used in hospital critical care settings, as well as safety systems for managing and delivering hazardous chemotherapy drugs. The San Clemente, California-based company said it expects 2016 adjusted profit of $4.60 per share on revenue of $370 million. Analysts were expecting $4.54 per share and revenue of $367.3 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. ICU Medical's financial advisers are Barclays and Wells Fargo Securities, while Latham & Watkins is its legal adviser.  Pfizer's financial advisers are Goldman Sachs and Guggenheim Securities. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Ropes & Gray LLP are its legal advisers. "

    "text": "The candy maker Mars Inc on Thursday said it would take full control of its Wrigley chewing gum business, acquiring the minority stake held by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N).    Mars plans to combine Wrigley with its chocolate business, putting M&Ms, Snickers, Starburst fruit chews, Doublemint and Extra gum, and Altoids mints under one roof. In 2008, Berkshire invested in Wrigley when it acquired $2.1 billion of preferred stock and $4.4 billion of bonds in connection with privately held Mars' $23 billion purchase of the chewing gum maker. The bonds were repurchased in 2013, and Berkshire expected Mars to redeem half of the preferred stock, which carries a 5 percent dividend, by early January. Mars will instead redeem all of it. Terms were not disclosed. \"I have enjoyed all of Berkshire's experiences with the Mars family and management and wish them the very best,\" Buffett said in a statement. \"Both Mars and Berkshire have profited from our investment and that's the way it should be.\" The global confectionery business, worth $183 billion last year according to Euromonitor International, has struggled as more consumers move toward healthier foods, prompting some retailers to reduce shelf space for processed and sugary snacks. \"We are grateful for the strong and productive partnership we have with Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway,\" Mars Chief Executive Grant Reid said in a statement. \"Sole ownership of Wrigley provides us with an opportunity to rethink how we simplify our chocolate and Wrigley businesses.\" Mars, the world's largest candy maker ahead of rivals such as Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) and Hershey Co (HSY.N), expects to combine its chocolate and Wrigley businesses during 2017 into Mars Wrigley Confectionery, with about 30,000 employees. The combined business will be based in Chicago, Wrigley's longtime home, and led by Martin Radvan, Wrigley's president and a 30-year veteran of Mars. Mars is based in McLean, Virginia.    Known for his taste in less-than-healthy food, Buffett has made Berkshire the largest shareholder of Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), and helped Brazil's 3G Capital take over Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) and Restaurant Brands International Inc (QSR.TO), which owns Burger King and Tim Hortons. Berkshire also owns See's Candies. But unwinding the Mars stake will deprive Berkshire of a $105 million annual income stream from the preferred stock. The investment was one of several that Buffett's Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate made during and soon after the financial crisis in brand name companies seeking to shore up their finances, and win the billionaire's imprimatur. From 2008 to 2011, Berkshire invested well over $20 billion in high-yielding securities from Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Dow Chemical Co (DOW.N), General Electric Co (GE.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Swiss Re AG (SRENH.S) and Wrigley. But many have been repurchased, forcing Buffett to find other ways to invest Berkshire's $72.7 billion of cash. He lost $720 million of annual income in June when Kraft Heinz, in which Berkshire still owns a 26.8 percent stake, redeemed preferred stock. The Wrigley notes had thrown off an 11.45 percent coupon.

    "text": "TORONTO Canadian merger and acquisition activity in the first nine months of the year touched their highest level since the financial crisis, buoyed by several big-ticket deals across a range of sectors, data from Thomson Reuters showed on Thursday. M&A deal value jumped 17 percent to $209.7 billion in the period, up from $178.9 billion from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. It was the best first nine months since 2007. Full-year figures will be available in January. Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Barclays Plc (BARC.L) and Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO) were the top three advisers for Canadian M&A in the period, followed by Goldman Sachs (GS.N), JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Bank of Montreal (BMO.TO). CIBC (CM.TO) took the third position among Canadian banks. The biggest deal of the year so far is Enbridge Inc's (ENB.TO) planned acquisition of Spectra Energy Corp (SE.N) at about $28 billion (C$37 billion). A move by Canadian fertilizer producers Potash Corp of Saskatchewan Inc (POT.TO) and Agrium Inc (AGU.TO) to combine in a merger of equals was another highlight. \"Investors in the market broadly are strongly endorsing these deals. People are very supportive of strategic M&A,\" said Derek Neldner, RBC's head of Canadian investment banking, who noted that there were several transformational deals this year. \"Fundamentally we find M&A activity is driven by confidence - board of director and management confidence,\" he added. RBC helped advise Potash Corp in its deal with Agrium, and Enbridge in its deal with Spectra.  After a lull in recent quarters, the traditional driver of Canadian deal activity - mining and resource M&A - has begun to pick up.  \"We're starting to see a slow but steady rebound in the resource sectors, and that generally leads to more M&A and fundraising,\" said Bruce Rothney, chief executive of Barclays Canada.  \"There's some evidence of a turning point in mining and, to a degree, oil and gas.\" Barclays advised Agrium and Spectra on their respective blockbuster deals.  Other highlights of the year include TransCanada's (TRP.TO) $10.2 billion acquisition of Columbia Pipeline Group and Fortis Inc's (FTS.TO) proposed $11.3 billion purchase of ITC Holdings Corp (ITC.N), which is expected to close by the end of the year.

    "date": "Thu Oct 6, 2016 | 9:30 AM EDT",
    "authour": " Addintional reporting by Vincent Lee, Norihiko Shirouzu and Sue-Lin Wong; Editing by Mark Potter",
    "text": "LONDON/MILAN/FRANKFURT Chinese firms including Shanghai Electric have approached Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) to express an interest in buying its Comau robotics business, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Any deal would follow a wave of European acquisitions by Chinese firms as they seek global scale and could help FCA pay down debt as well as fund an expensive investment plan. Chinese conglomerate Sinomach and Shanghai Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering (Simee) have also approached FCA over a possible bid for Comau, hoping to persuade FCA boss Sergio Marchionne to sell the Turin-based specialist in welding robots, one of the sources said. But FCA is currently focused on talks over a potential sale or partnership for its Magneti Marelli auto parts maker with South Korea's Samsung Electronics and is in no rush to consider options for Comau, a profitable unit with revenues of just under 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion), the sources added. FCA declined to comment, while Shanghai Electric, Sinomach and Simee were not immediately available to comment due to a national holiday in China. The world's seventh-largest carmaker has one of the highest debt piles in the industry and needs cash to fund an ambitious 48 billion euro investment plan, especially after Marchionne's proposal to tie up with U.S. rival General Motors was repeatedly rebuffed.  FCA chairman John Elkann said on Sept. 3 that FCA was in talks with several parties, including Samsung, and reviewing options for Magneti Marelli. A deal could be worth up to 4 billion euros depending whether Samsung buys all or part of Magneti Marelli, which makes components for lighting, engines, electronics, suspension and exhausts, among other items, the sources said. If successful, the sale of Magneti Marelli could pave the way to other disposals within FCA's auto parts division, which also includes Comau and castings firm Teksid, the sources said. Discussions between Samsung and FCA have been going on since the start of the summer but the two parties remain far from an agreement, the sources said. In fact, they have yet to hire banks to help negotiate the terms of a deal, they added. Samsung is only interested in certain parts of Magneti Marelli and the two companies may initially set up a partnership that could later evolve into a sale, they said. A Samsung spokesman declined to comment. Comau is Fiat's second biggest components business, with adjusted operating profit of 72 million euros in 2015. The unit, which employs 12,600 people in 17 countries, has also drawn interest from private equity funds, the sources said, cautioning no deal was certain. Comau, led by chief executive Mauro Fenzi, supplies process automation products to several FCA brands, including Chrysler, and its operations are intertwined with the rest of the group, making it hard to hive it off, the sources said. A partnership with one of the Chinese suitors is seen as a better option for FCA, one source said, although the Chinese bidders have mainly shown interest in a full acquisition. TAKEOVER FEVER Meanwhile, some private equity funds including U.S. buyout firm Marlin Equity Partners have set their sights on Teksid, the smallest of FCA's auto parts units with 2015 revenues of 631 million euros and an adjusted operating profit of 2 million euros, one of the sources said. But FCA is keeping buyout funds at arm's lengths, the sources said, and there are no talks underway. A spokesman at Marlin Equity Partners was not immediately available for comment. A sale of any of the units could help FCA pay off some debt at a time when it is highly exposed to a peaking U.S. auto market and its five-year investment plan is plagued by product delays. Chinese firms and other international automotive players are better positioned to buy FCA's auto parts units than private equity funds since Marchionne is wary of selling assets to financial investors and recently rebuffed bids from heavyweight funds for Magneti Marelli, the sources said. Aviation Industry of China [SASADY.UL] (Avic) could also make a move for FCA's units, particularly Comau, the sources said, as it seeks access to proprietary technology. Avic representatives could not be immediately reached for comment. Chinese firms have shown growing interest in European automotive assets as they look to boost their global presence, with Chinese household appliances company Midea Group recently buying industrial robot maker Kuka. China's voracious appetite for overseas acquisitions has propelled Asia to the forefront of global deal-making for the first time, with investment bankers hoping Chinese buyers will continue to support an otherwise slowing M&A market. Last year, state-backed ChemChina bought a majority of Italy's Pirelli, the world's fifth-largest tyre maker. It then bought Swiss seeds and pesticides group Syngenta for $43 billion in February, the largest Chinese deal this year.      "

    "text": "SEOUL Samsung Electronics Co (005930.KS) shares jumped to a record high on Thursday after activist investor Elliott Management submitted unsolicited proposals for a radical corporate makeover at the world's biggest smartphone maker. An attempt by the U.S. hedge fund to wring change at South Korea's biggest conglomerate last year failed in acrimony. But investors and analysts said Elliott's latest move could open the way for the founding Lee family to embrace change, cementing its grip as it negotiates succession from its ailing patriarch to the next generation and a hefty inheritance tax bill. The approach on Wednesday by Elliott, which owns 0.62 percent of Samsung Electronics, came as the tech giant faced fresh claims of problems with its flagship Note 7 smartphone, with a report that a handset began smoking inside a U.S. plane on Wednesday. Last month's global recall of 2.5 million devices is set to show up in modest earnings growth guidance the firm is expected to report on Friday. Samsung said it will \"carefully review\" Elliott proposals for splitting the firm into a holding vehicle for ownership purposes and an operating company, as well as a 30 trillion won ($27 billion) dividend from its $70 billion cash pile. Shares rose as much as 5 percent to a new record as other investors voiced support before closing up 4.5 percent. \"This came at the right time for Samsung,\" said Daishin Economic Research Institute analyst Ahn Sang-hee. \"It's as if someone came and hit their cheek just when they wanted to cry. In Samsung Group's case they have probably wanted to say something like this and now a foreign stakeholder has spoken up.\" The future of Samsung, including its succession plans, has been a matter of intense scrutiny since group patriarch Lee Kun-hee, now 74, was incapacitated by a heart attack in May 2014. Though there have been numerous theories on how the Lee heirs - Jay Y. Lee, 48, seen as the de facto leader of the Samsung Group conglomerate, and his two sisters - will ultimately secure control of Samsung Electronics, the group's flagship company, the family has yet to publicly discuss its plans. 'COMMON SENSE' Many analysts and investors believe Samsung Group will seek a \"de-merger\" along the lines sought by Elliott in a way that increases the Lees' direct control of the conglomerate's crown jewel. The family members' combined stake in Samsung Electronics is 4.9 percent, based on a Sept. 9 filing and the firm has a market value of about $230 billion. Samsung declined to comment on whether it was in direct contact with $27 billion fund Elliott on the latter's approach. Elliott on Wednesday said its proposal would allow the Lee family to retain its control of Samsung Electronics and also simplify the group's ownership structure. Relations between Samsung and Elliott, founded by billionaire Paul Singer, soured last year in a lengthy, bitter feud over a merger of two Samsung affiliates.  The deal, seen as a stepping stone in the family succession plan, was opposed by the fund as not offering investors full value but eventually went through. It was not immediately clear whether Elliott had already begun communicating with other shareholders, but some Samsung Electronics investors publicly backed the U.S. fund's push.  \"We are supportive of restructuring and a higher dividend payout to unlock the value in the business,\" Andrew Gillan, head of Asia ex-Japan at Henderson Global Investors, told Reuters in an email on Thursday. Henderson owns 0.12 percent of Samsung Electronics, according to Thomson Reuters data. Dutch pension fund APG Asset Management, which has a 0.8 percent stake, said it was positive about Elliott's proposals. \"Elliott is not making excessive demands. What they are saying is in line with common sense,\" said Park Yoo-kyung, a Hong Kong-based director specializing in corporate governance at the Dutch fund.  Analysts said Elliott's proposals will likely lead to further pressure from offshore investors for the conglomerate to open up on its plans and make sure their interests are protected in any further restructuring. Of Samsung Electronics' top 20 shareholders, a total of 11 are international investors, according to Thomson Reuters data.   Meanwhile a spokeswoman for South Korea's National Pension Service (NPS), the biggest investor in Samsung Electronics with a 9.2 percent stake, said it was monitoring the situation, but said it was too early to make comment. The NPS played a significant role in the Samsung-Elliott spat last year, its backing for the deal helping to secure its passage. ($1 = 1,109.9000 won) "

    "text": "GENEVA Governments have a massive opportunity to boost national trade if they think strategically about how standards and regulations help or hinder SMEs to export, the Geneva-based International Trade Center (ITC) said in a report published on Thursday. \"If you want to maximize your chances of getting your share of international trade, you need to be very strategic about where is the potential that you are not tapping into,\" the ITC's Executive Director Arancha Gonzalez told Reuters.  \"The government has a possibility to open the door for businesses to follow, rather than the government following the regulatory framework of businesses that are trying to swim in this current by themselves.\" The ITC, a joint agency of the United Nations and the World Trade Organization that helps SMEs to trade, says its 300-page report, \"Meeting the standard for trade\", offers a guide for small businesses and an action plan for governments. Standards and regulations are key to competitiveness and one of the defining elements of trade in the 21st century, Gonzalez said, as consumers become more and more savvy and picky about where products come from and what they contain.  \"Consumers are asking for more sophisticated standards. This is a huge challenge for SMEs, for governments, and for institutions. The option of no standards or lower standards is not an option,\" Gonzalez said.  Standards are diverse. They determine whether a plug fits into a socket, whether a medicine can be sold, and whether we can understand foreign traffic signs. Regulations can mean safety rules for food or cars, or privacy rules for data storage. In all cases governments need to back the rules up with testing and certification. The report identifies areas where countries are underperforming their export potential, which standards and regulations they should target to meet that potential, and what investments are needed. There is an opportunity for trade in processed and fresh food within the Middle East and North Africa, for example, where the number of technical regulations for fresh food imports is four times higher than in other regions, Gonzalez said. \"There is no internal trade because the manner in which they are regulating is hugely burdensome. So they don’t trade with each other, they only trade with the rest of the world.\"  Countries in the region could increase food exports to each other by $7.6 billion and to developing countries in Asia by $16.5 billion, the report said.   The Asia-Pacific region could export $400 billion more in IT and consumer electronics, and $1.7 trillion more overall, and had strong potential to diversify into chemicals exports, the report said. Meeting standards can open markets and raise prices, but Gonzalez said governments should \"craft\" regulation with SMEs in mind, since smaller firms make up 98 percent of businesses and their ability to trade suffers disproportionately from red tape.   \"A 10 percent increase in the regulatory burden means 1.6 percent less trade for large companies but 3.2 percent less trade for SMEs,\" she said.

The two companies aim to reach a deal this month, with some 2,000 Fujitsu workers likely move to Lenovo, the Nikkei business daily said on Thursday, without saying where it got the information. The deal, if realized, will make Fujitsu the second Japanese PC assembler after NEC Corp to seek the help of the world's largest PC maker to stay competitive in the thin margin market. Lenovo and NEC set up a PC joint venture in 2011. Fujitsu's shares gained 7 percent in early trade to hit their highest level since January, compared with a 0.6 percent gain for the broader market. Lenovo shares were up 2 percent. Fujitsu may transfer its design, development and manufacturing operations to a joint venture led by Lenovo or Lenovo may opt to buy a majority stake in the Japanese company's PC unit, the Nikkei said. It did not mention potential financial terms. Fujitsu said in a statement it was considering various options for the PC unit but had not yet made a decision on its future. Lenovo declined to comment. Fujitsu had initially negotiated with Toshiba Corp  and unlisted Vaio Corp, which was spun off from Sony Corp, for a three-way merger of their PC businesses. But the talks fell through earlier this year as the companies were unable to agree on the details. Global demand for PCs has been squeezed by sales of smartphones and tablet computers. Smaller makers less able to benefit from large scale production face an uncertain future. In the second quarter of this year, worldwide shipments of PCs were stronger than expected, but nonetheless shrank 4.5 percent from a year earlier to 62.4 million units, according to technology research company IDC.  Lenovo accounted for 21.2 percent of those shipments, followed by HP Inc with 20.8 percent, and Dell Inc [DI.UL] with 16 percent. Asustek computers Inc had a 7.2 percent share while Apple Inc held 7.1 percent.          Fujitsu shipped 4 million units in the year ended in March, mostly for the Japanese market, the company said.

Reza Food Services Co. Ltd, which owns and operates McDonald's restaurants in the western and southern region of Saudi Arabia, has tapped Malaysian bank CIMB (CIMB.KL) to finance the transaction, said two of the sources, who declined to be identified as the deal has not been publicly announced. The move is in line with McDonald's plans to bring in partners as it switches to a less capital-intensive franchise model in Asia. One person familiar with the Southeast Asian deal said McDonald's was keen to tie up with regional family-owned groups and local tycoons as it sought out long-term partners rather than buyout firms, which usually cash out of a business after a few years. Basic terms of the agreement had been finalised and the deal was expected to be completed by the year-end, the person said. CIMB declined to comment, while there was no immediate response from McDonald's. Reuters was not immediately able to reach Reza for a comment. Sources said CIMB would provide the bulk of the term loan to back the deal, and the financing would be denominated in both Malaysian ringgit and Singapore dollars. In July, McDonald's had said it was seeking franchise partners for its restaurants in Singapore and Malaysia and was negotiating with parties, but did not provide any details or a timeline. McDonald's has about 120 restaurants in Singapore and about 260 in Malaysia. Citing sources, Reuters reported last month that McDonald's had received final bids from at least three groups for its China and Hong Kong outlets. "

    "text": "SEOUL Tech giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said on Thursday it is carefully considering proposals by U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management and said it \"believes in constructive and open dialogue\" with investors. The U.S. fund on Thursday urged the crown jewel of South Korea's top conglomerate Samsung Group to split itself into a holding company and list its operating company on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Elliott also called for a special dividend. Samsung said in a statement it is committed to creating \"long-term, sustainable value\" for all stakeholders and that it aims to maximize shareholder value.

    "text": "Semiconductor equipment maker Lam Research Corp (LRCX.O) on Wednesday terminated its $10.6 billion deal to buy rival KLA-Tencor Corp after the U.S. Department of Justice told the companies it had serious concerns that the deal would harm competition. Shares of KLA-Tencor were down about 4 percent at $68.60 in extended trading, while Lam Research's shares fell 1.2 percent to $95.00. Lam Research agreed to buy KLA-Tencor for $67.02 per share last year, amid a wave of consolidation in the chip industry. Together, the companies would have commanded a 42 percent share of the wafer fabrication equipment market. U.S. government agencies have been wary that a further reduction in the number of suppliers in the semiconductor industry would drive up prices and perhaps curb innovation.  Last year, U.S.-based Applied Materials Inc was forced to scrap its $10 billion takeover of Japanese chip-making gear rival Tokyo Electron Ltd after the deal fell foul of U.S. antitrust regulators. (reut.rs/2dfWVHy) The latest deal \"presented concerns about the ability of the merged firm to foreclose competitors' development of leading edge fabrication tools and process technology on a timely basis,\" said Renata Hesse, Acting Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department's antitrust division. (bit.ly/2dfV3hQ) Lam Research and KLA-Tencor had cautioned in August that a regulatory clearance for the deal may not be obtained.  The companies said on Wednesday they now plan to explore collaboration opportunities around programs that would be beneficial to their customers. Both Lam Research and KLA-Tencor count Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) as major customers. KLA-Tencor also raised its quarterly dividend by 2 cents to 54 cents per share. Up to Wednesday's close, Lam Research's stock had risen 21.1 percent this year, while KLA-Tencor's had increased about 3 percent.  "

    "text": "Twitter Inc has told potential acquirers it is seeking to conclude negotiations about selling itself by the time it reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 27, according to people familiar with the matter. The timeline is hugely ambitious in the context of most mergers and acquisitions, given that Twitter began mulling a sale only last month. It is the clearest sign yet that Chief Executive Jack Dorsey is pushing to provide clarity to shareholders and employees over the company's future as quickly as possible. Binding acquisition offers are due in the next two weeks, and Twitter has already whittled down the field of potential acquirers, the people said this week. Salesforce.com Inc is in the running, while Google parent Alphabet Inc, and Walt Disney Co have also been contemplating bids, the people added. Recode reported on Wednesday, citing sources it did not identify, that Google would not move forward with a bid to acquire Twitter. It is not certain the process will result in a sale, the Reuters sources cautioned. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.    Twitter and Salesforce declined to comment. Disney and Google did not return requests for comment. With Salesforce.com, Twitter might turn its focus to customer service communications and mining its database of tweets for business intelligence. Google would likely be most interested in the social and news dimensions of Twitter. Disney, by contrast, might see it as a way to expand the reach of its sports and entertainment programming. Twitter has struggled to generate revenue growth and profit, despite having some 313 million average monthly active users and a growing presence as a source of news.  The company missed Wall Street's sales expectations in both the first and second quarters of 2016, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, and has yet to produce a net profit in 11 quarters as a public company. It has also failed to keep pace with rivals, notably Facebook Inc's Instagram and Snapchat. Both now boast more users than Twitter by most measures, even though they are much newer, and advertisers have begun to migrate their ad dollars accordingly. Dorsey, who returned to Twitter as chief executive more than a year ago, has been part of Disney's board since 2013. Twitter went public in November 2013 at $26 a share. The shares peaked above $74 just over a month after its IPO, but have been on a steady downward trajectory since.  "

Oi is in discussions with creditors to restructure 65.4 billion reais ($20.3 billion) of bank, bond and regulatory liabilities after filing for bankruptcy in June.  Wednesday's statement was a response to media reports saying the carrier had entered negotiations to receive investments of up to 10 billion reais from the U.S. hedge fund. Rio de Janeiro-based Oi owes industry regulator Anatel and state lenders Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3.SA), Caixa Econômica Federal SA and BNDES a combined 20 billion reais, making the government its second-biggest creditor after bondholders. On Wednesday evening, the federal auditing court (TCU) in Brasília made a preliminary ruling preventing Oi from entering into an agreement with telecoms regulator Anatel to convert about 10 billion reais of fines into investment commitments.

Samsung said in a statement it plans to integrate the San Jose-based company's AI platform, called Viv, into the Galaxy smartphones and expand voice-assistant services to home appliances and wearable technology devices. Financial terms were not disclosed.  Technology firms are locked in an increasingly heated race to make AI good enough to let consumers interact with their devices more naturally, especially via voice. Alphabet Inc's Google is widely considered to be the leader in AI, but others including Amazon.com, Apple and Microsoft have also launched their own offerings including voice-powered digital assistants. Samsung, the world's top smartphone maker, is also hoping to differentiate its devices, from phones to fridges, by incorporating AI.  The acquisition of Viv could help the Korean firm shore up its competitiveness at a time when Google's new Pixel smartphones - armed with the U.S. firm's voice-powered digital assistant - threatens Samsung and other smartphone makers who are largely reliant on the Android operating platform.             \"Viv brings in a very unique technology to allow us to have an open system where any third-party service and content providers (can) add their services to our devices' interfaces,\" Rhee In-jong, Samsung's executive vice president, told Reuters in an interview. The executive said Samsung needs to \"really revolutionize\" how its devices operate, moving towards using voice rather than simply touch. \"We can't innovate using only in-house technology,\" Rhee said.     Viv chief executive and co-founder Dag Kittlaus, a Siri co-creator, and other top managers at the firm will continue managing the business independently following the acquisition.  Rhee told Reuters Samsung will continue to look for acquisitions to bolster its AI and other software capabilities, without naming any targets.  "

    "text": "MEXICO CITY Mexico's Jose Cuervo, the world's biggest tequila producer, has delayed its planned initial public offering and will wait until after the U.S. presidential election before going ahead, three people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the three people said concern about market volatility around the Nov. 8 U.S. election meant that Cuervo had decided to postpone the listing, which they said had been scheduled for this month.     Representatives for Jose Cuervo did not respond to a request for comment on the delay, which appears to be the first instance of a major IPO being postponed because of concern about volatility surrounding the election, which has already roiled markets in Mexico. The company, known officially as Becle, announced the IPO slated for the Mexican bourse in a filing last week, but without saying when it would take place. It also plans a private placement to investors in the United States, where the tequila market has increasingly been shifting toward high-end 100 percent agave brands. A person familiar with the matter said last week the company could seek to raise between $500 million and $1 billion. Some investors in Mexico's currency and other instruments have grown apprehensive about the possibility of a win by Republican White House candidate Donald Trump, who has fired off a series of verbal broadsides against Mexico and its economy. Trump has vowed to build a wall on the border with Mexico that he said he would make Mexico pay for and threatened to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement if he wins. He has also berated U.S. firms that invest in Mexico. Concern about the election has been more glancing on U.S. equity markets, where optimism had been growing about a rebound in IPOs after occasionally choppy markets had dampened enthusiasm for new issues for much of the year.     Jose Cuervo made reference to the U.S. election in its prospectus, noting that any renegotiation of trade deals after the vote could ultimately have a serious impact on business. On Tuesday, Agustin Carstens, the head of Mexico's central bank, said the bank may not follow any impending interest rate increase by the U.S. Federal Reserve if the outcome of the U.S. presidential election is favorable to Mexico. Last week Carstens said a Trump victory would hit Mexico like a hurricane, and that a win by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton would yield a better outcome for the Mexican economy. The company has said proceeds from the IPO, due to be handled by Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Banco Santander and brokerage GBM Grupo Bursatil Mexicano, will be used to fund organic and external growth, as well as broaden its portfolio. Started by Jose Antonio de Cuervo in the late 1700s before Mexican independence from Spain, Jose Cuervo says it is North America's oldest continuous producer of spirits. With origins in the picturesque town of Tequila in Jalisco state, the business is now controlled by the Beckmann family. They will remain the majority shareholder after the IPO. "

    "text": "FOZ DO IGUAÇU, Brazil AGCO Corporation, a leading agricultural machinery maker, believes political changes in Brazil and Argentina could spur renewed farm investment in South America's two largest countries and revive the region's status as a growth area. After seeing sales dive in the two grain-producing nations plagued by deep recessions, AGCO is betting the arrival of more business friendly governments will prompt a revival in investment in the agricultural powerhouses, its chief executive told Reuters in an interview. The company even expects to see its first sales increase since 2013 as early as next year, chief executive Martin Richenhagen said on the sidelines of a four-day meeting with South American dealers in Foz do Iguaçu, a Brazilian city bordering Argentina and Paraguay. In Brazil, the world's biggest exporter of coffee, sugar and soy, centrist Michel Temer formally took over the presidency in August when left-leaning Dilma Rousseff was dismissed from office by the Senate on charges of breaking budget rules, in the midst of the worst economic downturn in decades. In Argentina, also a major exporter of soy and corn, President Mauricio Macri has steered the country to the center-right since taking office in December. \"Yes, we are pleased with the political changes,\" Richenhagen said. \"When Brazil comes back, it does so big time. So, we need to make sure we have the ability to react quickly.\"  The head of the Duluth, Georgia-based company also pointed to promising signs in Argentina after Macri scrapped most taxes on food exports and introduced new financing measures for farmers.  The German-born executive had branded the export taxes, introduced by the previous government of left-leaning Cristina Fernandez, a \"stupidity.\"  He has also criticized the way Brazil's former left-leaning government had stalled on granting farmers' requests for financing, saying Brasilia was slowing down the process to reduce spending.  AGCO sales in South America have been falling since 2013. Its production in the region went from 85,000 units per year in 2013 to 52,000 in 2015, and should fall by about 5 percent this year.  But the company expects to see the first sales increase in 2017, by an estimated 12 percent. That should help compensate for smaller sales in the United States as lower grains prices cut investments by American farmers. Despite recent setbacks, Richenhagen said that AGCO's investors were aware of Latin America's importance in a cyclical business environment. \"Around 80 percent of our business is done outside the U.S., which gives us a balanced portfolio so when things don't go well in a region they can be compensated in another,” he said. AGCO has seven plants in Brazil and one in Argentina. The company believes demand for agricultural machinery from the region will remain strong if financing is adequate. Farming data showed there was ample scope for increased investment, he said. While there are 12 hectares of farm land per tractor in Germany and 36 per tractor in the United States, there are 113 per machine in Brazil and 165 in Argentina. “So, yes, there are a lot of opportunities here,” he said.

According to the person, who asked for anonymity since the process is confidential, China Brazil Xinnenghuan International Investment Co is interested in buying 20 percent to 25 percent of Congonhas Minérios directly from CSN.  Talks are progressing slowly and may not result in a deal, the person said. Reuters reported on Sept. 26 that both companies were discussing the transaction, whose outcome also hinges on the ability of CSN to secure long-term supply contracts from CBSteel, as the Chinese company is known.  A spokesman for CSN did not have an immediate comment. Efforts to reach media representatives for CBSteel were unsuccessful. The stake sale in Congonhas Minérios is Chief Executive Officer Benjamin Steinbruch's most ambitious asset divestiture plan yet for CSN, which has the largest debt burden among Brazilian steelmakers. Optimism over the sale has driven shares of São Paulo-based CSN up 7 percent over the past week. Congonhas Minérios was created at the end of 2014, through the merger of CSN's fully owned Casa de Pedra mine and Namisa, an ore production joint venture with six Asian companies. Casa de Pedra has one of Brazil's best-quality iron ore reserves. The six Asian companies that own a combined 12 percent of Congonhas Minérios would keep their stakes unaltered if a deal between CSN and CBSteel materializes, the person said.  They include Japan's Itochu Corp, Nisshin Steel Co Ltd, JFE Steel Corp and Kobe Steel Ltd as well as Korea's Posco Ltd and Taiwan's China Steel Corp.       "

She has previously worked with U.S. law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP in New York and London, as well as Osler in Toronto. Faced with increasing competition and digital disruption, law firms have been responding with strategies that leverage technology.

The team, which is called Osler Works — Transactional, is expected to grow, she said. The five-member team includes four lawyers. \"Clients are putting a lot of pressure on law firms to make changes to the way they practice. This model is put out there by Osler to respond to those needs\", Munroe said. Ottawa was chosen because Osler has a presence there and the city is a relatively lower-cost location, she said, adding that the team will use a number of technology-driven applications for its functions. Osler has a strong M&A practice. Last year, Osler was the top law firm advising on Canadian M&A transactions, followed by McCarthy Tétrault and Torys, according to Thomson Reuters data. "

    "text": "TOKYO/WASHINGTON Japanese insurer Sompo Holdings Inc (8630.T) said on Wednesday it will buy U.S. property and casualty insurer Endurance Specialty Holdings Ltd (ENH.N) for $6.3 billion, the latest in a string of acquisitions by insurers starved of growth in aging Japan. Japan's insurance companies have been aggressively buying U.S. businesses, announcing a slew of multibillion-dollar deals as they seek to expand beyond a rapidly maturing home market - with the exception of Sompo, which lacked a significant U.S. foothold. Sompo, the nation's third-largest property and casualty insurer with a market value of $12 billion, said it has agreed to buy 67.7 million shares in Endurance Specialty at $93 each, a premium of 40.3 percent against the stock's average price since July. Chief Executive Kengo Sakurada said at a news conference the premium was not high given the premiums paid by other Japanese insurers in overseas deals. He also said Endurance's management, including Chief Executive John Charman, would remain in place. \"We want the current management to stay, so we are paying for a control premium,\" he said. The deal is the second-largest ever by a Japanese insurer, after Tokio Marine Holdings Inc's (8766.T) $7.5 billion purchase of U.S. insurer HCC Insurance Holdings Inc last year. Tokio Marine paid a premium of 35.8 percent. Endurance, which has a market value of $6 billion, focuses on underwriting specialty lines of personal and commercial property and casualty insurance and reinsurance. In 2015, the company had $3.3 billion in gross premiums written - insurers' equivalent of revenue - and $355 million in net income. Sompo will deploy Endurance's underwriting know-how for customers with global businesses, it said in a statement. The deal will benefit Sompo in the longer term by allowing it to offer specialized insurance products in the domestic market, said analyst Koichi Niwa at SMBC Nikko. \"If Sompo goes abroad, gets solid know-how of insurance products, and brings it back to Japan, synergies will emerge.\" Sompo said it will fund the deal with cash on hand. In August, it raised 200 billion yen ($1.95 billion) by issuing subordinated bonds, part of which can be counted as equity. On Wednesday, Sompo's shares closed up 2.7 percent before the deal was confirmed. Endurance shares soared 35 percent on Tuesday on reports of the deal. Citi Group and Morgan Stanley acted as financial advisers for Sompo and Endurance, respectively. Sompo received legal advice from Shearman & Sterling LLP and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP provided external legal counsel to Endurance. The United States is the world's largest market for both life and property-casualty insurers, where Japanese companies see opportunities to secure instant boosts to profit through acquisitions. In other major U.S. deals announced last year by Japanese insurers, Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance Co acquired StanCorp Financial Group Inc for $5 billion and Sumitomo Life Insurance Co purchased Symetra Financial Corp for about $3.8 billion. MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings Inc (8725.T) also announced a $5.3 billion acquisition of Britain's Amlin PLC, an underwriter in the Lloyd's of London specialist insurance market. Sompo, formerly NKSJ Holdings Inc, bought Britain's Canopius Group Ltd, a Lloyd's of London insurance market player, for about $1 billion in 2013. CEO Sakurada said future acquisitions were possible. \"(In Endurance) we've got a diamond in our hand,\" he said. \"But if this alone isn't enough to capture growth in the U.S. market, we won't rule out further M&As.\" ($1 = 102.8100 yen) "

Explaining its decision a day later, the AMF said that Luxembourg-based Altice had provided \"imprecise\" information about how SFR would compensate its mother company that was needed by minority shareholders to analyze the offer. The AMF said the offer was not rejected because of the exchange offer itself, even though it was at the lowest point in a range an independent appraiser came up with. \"In this context, it is therefore not possible to consider that the information provided to the minority shareholders, including the basis of the selected exchange ratio, is complete, intelligible and consistent\" with French rules, the AMF said in a statement. Altice, a telecoms and media group controlled by Franco-Israeli billionaire Patrick Drahi, had wanted to simplify the group's structure by exchanging 8 Altice class A shares for 5 SFR Group shares for the 22.25 percent of SFR shares it does not own.

SVG, which is fending off a $1.35 billion bid from U.S. rival HarbourVest, said it was \"urgently\" evaluating the proposal. The statement comes a day after SVG said it would sell half of its investment portfolio for 379 million pounds ($483 million) and wind down operations by the end of 2017. SVG said winding down would be a better option for its shareholders, compared to accepting the HarbourVest offer. The company's proposal to wind down was backed by Standard Life Investments (SL.L), which holds a 2 percent stake. Standard Life supported the SVG board's recommendation to maximize shareholder value by liquidating the portfolio in an orderly manner, a representative of the British insurer and asset manager said in an email on Wednesday. Following SVG's statement, HarbourVest said late on Wednesday that Aviva Investors (AV.L) and Legal & General Investment Management (LGEN.L), which together own about 7.3 percent of SVG's shares, had withdrawn their letters of intent to vote in favor of its offer. The Boston-based PE firm said earlier in the day that its offer gave the British company's shareholders a \"clean break\", compared with the risks associated with winding down operations. SVG also said on Tuesday it had in-principle agreed to sell half of its investment portfolio to Pomona Capital and Pantheon Ventures at a 7.8 percent discount.  If that sale goes through, shareholders should get 288 pence per share in November and another 192 pence per share early in 2017, Liberum analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday.

    "text": "CHICAGO A U.S. judge on Wednesday halted a lawsuit against Caesars Entertainment Corp (CZR.O), saying it could derail last week's $5 billion agreement that was aimed at extracting the casino company from a costly bankruptcy. While a vast majority of Caesars creditors agreed to drop some $13 billion in legal claims against the casino group last week, a hedge fund with a $9.4 million claim refused to back the deal and sought to pursue its lawsuit.  Trilogy Capital Management is one of several hedge funds that had accused Caesars of scrapping a guarantee on the debt of its bankrupt subsidiary, Caesars Entertainment Operating Co Inc (CEOC). A judgment in New York was due as soon as Thursday. \"The risk that the Trilogy action will derail the reorganization is too great,\" Judge Benjamin Goldgar said in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Chicago on Wednesday.  CEOC has secured the support of creditors who until last week were threatening its Nasdaq-listed parent with billions of dollars in claims over a series of transactions prior to the unit's bankruptcy filing in January 2015 with $18 billion of debt.  Shares of Caesars were up 1 percent at $7.72 in afternoon trade. The stock has risen about 14 percent since the company unveiled its sweetened offer for holdout creditors on Sept. 21. Goldgar said the injunction on all remaining litigation against Caesars was necessary to preserve the settlement and could last through a January trial to confirm CEOC's reorganization plan.    Trilogy immediately appealed Goldgar's ruling and U.S. District Court Judge Robert Gettleman in Chicago scheduled a Dec. 5 hearing. CEOC filed a formal restructuring support agreement with all of its major creditors on Wednesday, subject to certain conditions such as the injunction on litigation against Caesars remaining in place. It said the agreement is a \"key milestone\" in its effort to implement a consensual restructuring. CEOC will cut over $10 billion of debt and split into an operating company and a separate real estate investment trust as part of its plan to emerge from bankruptcy in 2017. Following the restructuring, private equity shareholders Apollo Global Management (APO.N) and TPG Capital Management LP [TPG.UL] will hold 16 percent in a new Caesars casino group. Apollo and TPG formed Caesars through the $30 billion leveraged buyout of Harrah's Entertainment in 2008, just before the U.S economy tipped into recession.  "

Swiss finance blog InsideParadeplatz on Wednesday reported its owners had given Chief Executive Walter Berchtold, in the job since Oct. 1, a directive to sell the bank. The report cited Geneva-based Banque Heritage as a possible buyer. Falcon said it had never held talks with Heritage over a possible sale. Banque Heritage was not immediately available for comment through an external communications representative. InsideParadeplatz's author, Lukas Haessig, said he is standing  by the story. Falcon is under scrutiny in Singapore after the central bank disclosed in late July that an on-site inspection of the group in April 2016 found \"substantial breaches\" of anti-money laundering regulations. Singapore said Falcon's management of key client relationships were done from the bank's head office in Switzerland and that the examination was still ongoing. The inspection was part of Singapore's money laundering probe linked to Malaysian state fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB), under which the central bank has questioned several banks since last year. Falcon owner IPIC is currently merging with fellow Abu Dhabi-owned investment fund Mubadala, as the emirate aims to consolidate in response to lower oil prices. "

    "text": "HONG KONG Hong Kong-based Bank of East Asia (0023.HK) said it has agreed to sell its share registry arm Tricor Holdings to private equity firm Permira for HK$6.5 billion ($837.91 million) in a deal that will bolster the lender's capital reserve. Tricor provides corporate services and its stable and steady cash generation is attractive to private equity firms. Permira's offer values Tricor at about 15 times its core earnings of about $55 million last year. The all-cash deal marks the first major sale of any business by Bank of East Asia, which was established nearly a century ago and whose offerings include corporate and retail banking, wealth management and investment services.  Bank of East Asia announced plans to review its 75.6 percent stake in Tricor in February this year. Hong Kong port operator NWS Holdings Ltd, backed by billionaire Cheng Yu-tung, owns the remaining stake and is also selling out. The bank, like several other financial firms, has been hit by regulatory challenges and a slowdown in the Chinese and Hong Kong economies. It posted a 37 percent drop in half-yearly profit, hit by a surge in loan impairment losses. The cash generated from the transaction will improve Bank of East Asia's capital position, and will be used for \"strategic opportunities\" relating to its core banking business, the lender told the stock exchange in a statement on Wednesday. The bank is likely to book a profit of about HK$3.1 billion after the divestment, after deducting relevant transaction costs and expenses, and the carrying amount of Tricor of about HK$1.6 billion on the book of the bank as of end-August, it said. Reuters reported last week Permira emerged as the preferred bidder to buy Tricor for between $750 million and $800 million, after six months of bidding that attracted the interest of top Chinese insurers, among others. Permira, which manages 31 billion euros ($34.8 billion) of investments globally, emerged as the dark horse in the auction in which Vistra Group, a business owned by Baring Asia Private Equity, was seen as the front runner. While several Hong Kong-based family-owned banks have sold out due to deteriorating market conditions, Bank of East Asia has survived as an independent bank in a market that is dominated by HSBC (HSBA.L) and Standard Chartered Plc (STAN.L). The bank, run by the founding Li family, however, has been facing pressure from activist investor Elliott Management which has been agitating for the sale of the bank and in July filed a lawsuit against the bank over a share placement. The dispute has pitted the hedge fund founded by billionaire Paul Singer against the bank's chairman and former politician David Li, whose grandfather founded the bank and whose family is among the city's best connected. Goldman Sachs (GS.N) acted as financial advisor to Bank of East Asia and NWS Holdings, while HSBC (HSBA.L) advised Permira on the deal. ($1=7.7574 Hong Kong dollars) "

    "text": "HO CHI MINH CITY State-owned Sabeco, Vietnam's biggest brewer, may list on the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange by late November or early December, its chief executive said, as the government moves towards loosening its tight grip over one of Asia's most sought-after beer markets.     Ho Chi Minh City-based Sabeco, formally known as the Saigon Beer, Alcohol, Beverage Corp, is one of the last profitable assets owned by the Vietnamese government, which has said it would sell its entire 89 percent in Sabeco by 2017. The stake is worth an estimated $1.8 billion.  All shares of Sabeco, known for its Bia Saigon and 333 brews, could be listed on the exchange, CEO Le Hong Xanh told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. The government has said it wants to list Sabeco before selling 53.59 percent this year and the remainder in 2017, but Xanh said all options for the government's stake divestment were being considered and the government had yet to approve any particular course of action. \"The listing could be in late November, early December, according to the consulting contract and agreement, but how fast it is depends on many other factors, like transparency in management and other conditions like tax,\" Xanh said. With a leading 43 percent share of Vietnam's beer production, Sabeco's net profit jumped 27 percent in the first-half of 2016 to 2.39 trillion dong ($107 million), and the CEO forecast full-year profit could grow 14 percent.  Xanh's comments come a day after a Vietnam deputy minister said listings of Sabeco and smaller brewer Habeco could be delayed until the first quarter of 2017. The brewers' share debuts had been scheduled for the end of 2016.     Vietnam's beer market grew at an average compound annual rate of 7 percent from 1999 to 2015, touching about 4 billion liters in 2016. Growth is slowing, however, and is anticipated at around 4 percent to 2021, data from research firm Canadean quoted by investment bank Liberum showed. Several major foreign brewers are eyeing Sabeco since the government earmarked it for privatization, but potential partners keen to exploit changing lifestyles and a fast-growing middle class have faced repeated delays. Kirin (2503.T), Asahi Group Holdings (2502.T), Thai Bev (TBEV.SI) and Heineken (HEIN.AS) had previously expressed interest in the stake sale. But Xanh said the process has restarted and interested buyers would have to bid again, declining to name any specific investors. \"There are many interested investors but we haven't started talking specifically with anyone; many financial institutions, funds, foreign beer firms, but all are waiting for the government,\" Xanh said. Asahi spokesman Takuo Soga said his company has earlier acknowledged interest in buying shares of Sabeco and that stance has not changed. A Kirin spokesman declined to comment on Sabeco. Heineken, which holds a 20 percent market share in Vietnam via its local joint-venture according to Liberum, declined to comment. A banking source having close connections with Thai Bev and who has direct knowledge about the deal said Thai Bev is one of the interested investors. Thai Bev did not respond to Reuters' queries for comment. "

    "text": "TOKYO Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd (7267.T) and Yamaha Motor Co Ltd (7272.T) on Wednesday said they were joining forces to develop scooters for the domestic market, burying the hatchet on a decades-old rivalry and consolidating production in response to a shrinking motorcycle market. Honda, the world's largest motorcycle brand by sales, said it would start producing Yamaha's 50-cc engine scooter models for the domestic market at its plant in southern Japan by the end of 2018, based on the manufacturing platform for Honda's small scooter models. The two companies said that pooling resources would be a way to mitigate increasing costs to develop new scooter technologies and keep pace with ever-tightening emissions regulations in the face of falling domestic scooter sales. \"The slowdown in the scooter market seen in the past few years has made business in the sector very difficult for both companies, so partnering will have merits,\" Honda operating officer Shinji Aoyama told reporters. Both companies said they would continue to market scooters separately, and that the partnership was limited to Japan. By far the largest market for both companies is Asia ex-Japan, where a growing demand for scooters from an expanding middle class has created their biggest battleground. Yamaha managing executive officer Katsuaki Watanabe said having Honda manufacture Yamaha models on contract would likely be more cost efficient than Yamaha's current arrangement of producing the vehicles in Taiwan and exporting them back home. The two companies said they would also jointly update their respective delivery scooter models, which Honda may also manufacture for Yamaha, while also considering collaboration on electric scooter projects. The partnership stands in contrast to a bitter rivalry between Honda, the top seller of scooters in Japan, and second-ranked Yamaha which dates back to around 1980, when both companies released dozens of motorcycle models and competed over distribution and pricing to increase market share. \"There's absolutely no bad feeling or ill will left over from that period,\" Yamaha's Watanabe said. Since then, overall domestic sales of motorcycles and scooters have fallen sharply due to a slump in demand from a rapidly growing elderly population and falling interest in vehicle ownership among younger consumers particularly in the past few years. Sales fell 10.6 percent to 373,000 motorcycles in the year ended March 2015, their second year of decline and a drop from the 1.2 million motorbikes sold in 1995.  Motorcycles are a key part of both companies' product line-ups, although domestic sales contribute little to global revenue. "

    "text": "SINGAPORE/COLOMBO Private equity firm TPG and fund company BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) are among half a dozen firms which have shown preliminary interest in a 49 percent stake in loss-making SriLankan Airlines Ltd, people familiar with the matter said.     They said Sri Lanka is looking to sell the stake in the national carrier along with management control. The restructuring is part of a broader move by the government to reduce support for state-owned firms and cut debt.     In July, a unit of state-run National Savings Bank, the lead manager overseeing SriLankan Airlines' revamp, invited offers from strategic investors who would assume responsibility for turning around the airline and its budget subsidiary Mihin Lanka. A senior Sri Lankan finance ministry official said TPG and BlackRock were the two top international firms among the bidders. He declined to be identified as the bids are still being evaluated. \"The government is looking at someone to solve the airline's struggles,\" said another source familiar with the matter, who declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to the media. BlackRock and TPG declined to comment. It was not immediately clear who the other bidders were. BNP Paribas and KPMG are the financial and transaction advisors on the airline's restructuring. SriLankan Airlines was a profitable 10-year joint venture with Emirates Airline until the pair split in 2008.  Subsequent mismanagement left the airline saddled with debt of around $3.25 billion, according to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. \"The expectation from the partner is capital. If you keep the debt out, it will have a positive valuation,\" Suren Ratwatte, CEO of SriLankan Airlines told Reuters on Wednesday. He declined to go into details. According to the sources, the government has indicated it would take on a substantial portion of the debt. They said the government is expected to draw a shortlist and pick a final bidder in the next couple of months. It was premature to estimate the potential value of any deal, they added. SriLankan Airlines has attractive routes to India and analysts have said potential investors could be drawn to the prospect of turning around the carrier, which has about 21 leased Airbus planes. Srilankan Airlines reported a net loss of 16.33 billion rupees ($112 million) for the year to March 31, narrower than its 31.4 billion rupees a loss year earlier on lower oil prices. It last made a profit in 2009, a year after Emirates sold its stake. Ratwatte said the partner will have to decide on any lay offs among the 7,000-strong staff. "

    "text": "AMSTERDAM NN Group NV (NN.AS), the largest Dutch insurer by market capitalization, on Wednesday said it had launched an unsolicited offer to buy smaller rival Delta Lloyd NV (DLL.AS) for 2.4 billion euros ($2.7 billion) in cash. Reuters reported last week that industry executives believe the low interest rate environment will lead to a new wave of consolidation in the European insurance market, driven by the potential for cost savings. The NN offer also comes after a long period of turmoil for Nedlloyd with two successive share issues made to strengthen its balance sheet with the introduction of Europe's new Solvency II capital adequacy rules for insurers. NN, which was spun off from ING (INGA.AS) with very strong capital ratios, has seen its shares rise 19 percent over the past two years, while Delta Lloyd's has fallen 71 percent after  issuing new shares twice in the same period -- once despite fierce objections from shareholders who said it was unnecessary [uL5N16O4HV]. NN Group said it has offered 5.30 euros per Delta share, a 29 percent premium over the stock's closing price on Tuesday, and 53 percent higher than its three-month average.  NN Chief Executive Lard Friese said, \"We believe there is a clear and compelling logic to bring consolidation to the Dutch insurance market through a combination of the businesses of NN Group and Delta Lloyd in a way that benefits both companies and their stakeholders.\"  Hostile takeovers are extremely rare in the Netherlands, in part because companies including Delta Lloyd are armed with an array of defenses to thwart unwanted advances.  Friese said the combined company would become a leading player in insurance, banking and asset management, benefiting from cost cutting and economies of scale. Delta Lloyd said it had received the offer Oct. 3 and is considering it, together with bankers Goldman Sachs and lawyers Allen & Overy.    Analysts at William Hawkins said the offer was worth about 12 times Delta Lloyd's 2016 free capital generation target of 200-250 million euros, with \"synergies we think are likely substantial.\" \"We would expect Delta Lloyd’s share price to trade above the current offer price today and we doubt their management team will accept this first offer,\" they said in a note. Delta Lloyd shares were up by nearly 29 percent at 5.3010  euros by 0755 GMT, when NN's share price was down 3.3 percent at 28.10 euros. Separately Delta Lloyd announced on Wednesday it would legally merge its Dutch and Belgian operations, which it said would lead to a 5 percentage point improvement in its Solvency II capital ratio.     After second-quarter earnings NN reported a Solvency II ratio of 252 percent of the minimum level of core capital required, while Delta Lloyd's stood at 173 percent of its minimum requirement after it had sold 650 million euros worth of shares in a dilutive rights issue at 2.85 euros per share, and after it sold its 30 percent stake in bank Van Lanschot (VLAN.AS) for 180 million euros. NN Group is the largest stock market-listed Dutch insurer by market capitalization, followed by Aegon NV (AEGN.AS) whose business is mostly in the United States. ASR (ASRNL.AS), a diversified, recently privatized insurer is third-ranked while life insurer Delta Lloyd is now fourth.  ($1 = 0.8917 euros) "

    "text": "WASHINGTON Leading U.S. banks on Tuesday submitted updated \"living wills\" to regulators who must decide whether Wall Street firms can be unwound without taxpayer help or should be broken up. Eight of the largest banks handed in paperwork on how they would be dissolved in a crisis to the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp before those regulators pass judgment in the months ahead. The eventual ruling from regulators could be definitive for Wall Street, said John Simonson, a former FDIC supervisor. \"This is an existential matter for leading banks,\" said Simonson, now with PricewaterhouseCoopers. \"The issue has the attention at the highest level of these banks.\" In April, five banks were told that their living wills fell short. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), State Street Corp (STT.N) and Bank of New York Mellon Corp(BK.N) were given until this month to revise their plans. The Fed and FDIC may issue a grade for those banks before the end of the year, Simonson said, though the entire banking sector will hear from regulators next summer. Any leading bank that cannot present a living will faces costly penalties and could be set on a course for a breakup within two years. In documents released on Tuesday, banks detailed how they planned to remedy problems regulators had identified earlier this year. For instance, JPMorgan said it had \"meaningfully simplified\" the way it funds entities within the company, especially those based in the U.K. Funding foreign subsidiaries during a time of crisis became an important issue after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, whose U.K. trading business created funding problems. Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) said it had increased staff devoted to resolution planning. The bank also put a senior executive in charge of that office, which now reports directly to the chief financial officer. "

The AMF watchdog said the offer by Altice (ATCA.AS) to buy the shares it did not already own in telecoms group SFR (SFRGR.PA) did not comply with rules. It gave no reason to explain this rare decision but said it would soon do so. \"This is totally incomprehensible,\" Combes told Reuters in a phone interview.  \"At a time when many wonder, because of Brexit, to which big economic and financial center they should move ... this is sending a signal of complete unpredictability,\" he said. Altice, the Luxembourg-based telecoms and media group controlled by Franco-Israeli billionaire Patrick Drahi, wanted to simplify the group's structure by exchanging 8 Altice class A shares for 5 SFR Group shares for the outstanding 22.25 percent of SFR shares it does not yet own. \"Our offer is over and we'll move on to something else,\" Combes said in the interview, although he added that the group might still appeal against the watchdog's decision. Altice said in a statement that its industrial strategy and plans for growth in France and abroad remained unchanged.  \"Altice regrets this decision, which goes against the interests of both companies, their shareholders and employees,\" the statement said.     SFR said separately that it had taken note of AMF's decision, without any other comment. The AMF declined to comment. It is likely to publish late on Wednesday a statement explaining its decision. "

Sears' shares jumped as much as 20.4 percent, their biggest intraday percentage gain in nearly two years, after being halted for volatility. The stock has lost more than half its value in the last 12 months. Apex Tool Group and Sweden's Husqvarna AB (HUSQb.ST) have also explored possible offers, Bloomberg reported.

Sears Holdings, controlled by billionaire CEO Edward Lampert's hedge fund, declined to comment. The retailer said in May that it was seeking options such as partnerships or other arrangements to expand its Sears Home Services business and the unit that houses the Kenmore appliance, Craftsman tools and DieHard vehicle battery brands beyond its Sears and Kmart stores. Once the largest U.S. retailer, Sears has lost its standing as customers move to either online shopping or rivals such as Target Corp (TGT.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N).

    "text": "LONDON Four bidders are vying for UniCredit's (CRDI.MI) fund management arm Pioneer as the auction for the $3.35 billion unit moves to the second round of bidding, two sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.  Europe's biggest asset manager Amundi (AMUN.PA) and an Italian consortium led by Poste Italiane (PST.MI) are seen as the frontrunners after submitting the highest non-binding offers in September, the sources said. But two other companies, Australia's Macquarie (MQG.AX) and British group Aberdeen Asset Management (ADN.L), are also interested in Pioneer and they're currently performing due diligence on the business which has over 220 billion euros ($246 billion) of assets under management, the sources said.  UniCredit, Amundi, Poste Italiane, Macquarie and Aberdeen declined to comment.  UniCredit seeks to raise around 3 billion euros from the sale of Pioneer, a deal seen as crucial to plug a gap in its capital requirements estimated to be as big as 8 billion euros.  Italian insurer Assicurazioni Generali (GASI.MI), the country's largest asset manager, has been unable to make a competitive offer amid a lack of shareholder support, the sources said. French insurer Axa (AXAF.PA) has also failed to progress to the second round of the auction, the sources said, while French bank Natixis (CNAT.PA) has been given the opportunity to sweeten its non binding offer, which came close to meeting UniCredit's expectations but was lower than the other four bids. Assicurazioni Generali and Axa declined to comment and Natixis was not immediately available for comment. Unicredit's French boss Jean-Pierre Mustier, appointed in July, will unveil a new strategic and capital-boosting plan for the Italian bank on Dec. 13. He will not select the final buyer for Pioneer until after a referendum on Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's flagship constitutional reform on Dec. 4. The fate of the Italian government likely hinges on the outcome of the referendum, and political instability in case of a 'No' vote could overshadow UniCredit's fund-raising efforts. APPETITE FOR DEALS UniCredit is currently conducting a wide-ranging review of its businesses with a view to selling more assets and reducing the size of any share issue. Other big European banks who run asset management units such as Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) are also expected to review options for those businesses which appeal to industry rivals as well as private equity funds, bankers and analysts said. For the likes of Amundi, Aberdeen and Anima Spa (ANIM.MI) -- an Italian fund manager which has teamed up with Poste Italiane and state-backed bank Cassa Depositi e Prestiti -- the purchase of Pioneer offers an opportunity to build scale across several international markets, including the United States. Amundi, which has almost $1 trillion of assets under management, was created from the merger of the asset management arms of French banks Credit Agricole (CAGR.PA) and Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) in 2010 and is now valued at 7.5 billion euros, having been listed on Euronext Paris last November. Analysts expect a flurry of deals among mid-sized asset managers who need to streamline operations and diversify in order to protect profits as clients push fees down and regulators ramp up scrutiny of fund managers' practices.  London-based asset manager Henderson Group (HGGH.L) agreed to buy U.S. rival Janus Capital Group Inc (JNS.N) on Monday in an all-share $6 billion deal to cut costs and boost profits.

    "text": "U.S. defense contractor Harris Corp (HRS.N) has launched the sale of parts of its Critical Networks division, according to people familiar with the matter, its first divestiture move after striking a deal with activist hedge fund Jana Partners. The asset sale, which could fetch more than $1 billion, comes after Harris, a major supplier of U.S. Army radios, signed an agreement with Jana in August to add two new independent directors to its board. Harris promised at the time to continue to assess its portfolio to identify non-core assets.  Harris' information technology services operation, which sits within Critical Networks, is among the divisions up for sale, the people said this week, citing marketing materials sent to potential buyers. This and other parts of Critical Networks could draw more than $500 million in the sale, the sources said. The company's business that supplies communications services to the energy industry, known as Harris CapRock Communications, is also expected to be sold in a separate process, according to the sources. CapRock could also attract offers of more than $500 million, the sources said. Selling off sections of that division would help the company lower its energy industry exposure, in addition to reducing its debt load.    The sources asked not to be identified because the sale process is not yet public. Harris declined to comment. Shares of Harris were flat at $91.38 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. The Melbourne, Florida-based company, with around $7.5 billion in annual revenue, is organized into four business segments: communication systems, which sells military and civilian radios; space and intelligence systems; electronic systems; and critical networks.  \"When we believe a business is not core to our strategy to drive shareholder value, we undertake proactive steps, as evidenced by the recent sale of Aerostructures and the sale of our commercial healthcare and broadcast communications businesses in prior years,\" Harris CEO Bill Brown told analysts on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call on Aug. 2. Harris said in its fiscal year-end report that revenue pressure would likely increase next year. It pointed to CapRock's energy industry exposure and weakness in its IT segment as among the reasons behind the revenue pressure.  The company's fiscal 2016 net income dipped 3 percent to $324 million, it said in August. The company's shares have risen 5.3 percent year-to-date, while the S&P 500 Index .INX is up 5.9 percent. Harris has a market capitalization of $11.3 billion.  "

The company also said it would simplify its operating structure by halving its 32 business units and create a new global online business. The businesses to be sold had sales of about $1.5 billion last year and include the majority of Newell's tools business; the winter sports businesses; heaters, humidifiers and fans businesses within consumer solutions; and its storage container business. This would include sale of a portion of the Rubbermaid storage business which makes large organizer containers, a spokeswoman said. Other Rubbermaid products such as containers for keeping produce fresh remain a priority for the company, she added. The company bought Jarden, the maker of Yankee Candle and Crock-Pot cookware in April, which added about 120 brands to Newell's portfolio. The combined company is estimated to have annual revenue of $16 billion. The actions announced on Tuesday would not impact Newell's 2016 forecast for core sales growth of 3-4 percent and adjusted earnings of $2.75-$2.90 per share, the company said.      Newell said the sale processes were underway and it hoped to complete the divestitures in the first half of 2017. The sale proceeds would be used to accelerate pay down of debt. The restructuring would help the company invest more and grow its \"highest potential categories\" such as writing, home fragrance, baby, food storage, appliances and cookware, and outdoor and recreation, Newell President Mark Tarchetti said. Newell said in April it would offload a number of businesses with annual revenue of $250 million-$300 million in the next two to three years, the majority of which would be from the Jarden portfolio. The company's shares were flat at $52.26 in morning trading on Tuesday.  "

    "text": "ZURICH ABB (ABBN.S) will keep its Power Grids business in a rejection of demands from an activist investor to spin it off and the Swiss engineering group has also unveiled plans for a $3 billion share buy back from next year. The Zurich-based company's long-awaited decision disappointed Cevian Capital, ABB's second biggest shareholder, which had wanted Power Grids to become a separate entity. Investor AB, ABB's largest shareholder, backed the decision to hold on to it. ABB said on Tuesday it had made this choice to take advantage of trends like smart grids and linking renewable energy production to consumers and that this was a better option than selling, floating, or spinning off the business. Cevian Capital, which has a 6.2 percent stake in ABB, was disappointed. \"ABB is a collection of top-quality businesses whose performance has been hindered for many years by the company's conglomerate structure,\" Christer Gardell, Cevian's Managing Partner & co-founder, said. Cevian said separating ABB and Power Grids, which makes parts for offshore wind turbines, could create two companies with combined share price of 35 Swiss francs ($35.80). \"The board has decided to keep the conglomerate structure. We think this is an unfortunate decision. The board and management team will be held accountable for realising 35 francs,\" Gardell said. ABB's shares, which despite a recovery in 2016, have lagged rivals like General Electric (GE.N), Siemens (SIEGn.DE) and Legrand (LEGD.PA) over the past five years.  ABB's shares were up about 0.8 percent at 22.14 Swiss francs at 13.02 GMT. ABB Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer said he had had a \"friendly and open\" conversation with Cevian early on Tuesday, without giving further details. \"Cevian and ABB have a lot in common,\" he told reporters. \"We will drive a lot of value creation for our shareholders.\" Chief Financial Officer Erik Elzvik said it would be possible for ABB to increase its share price to 35 Swiss francs, but did not give a time frame. Power Grids is the least profitable of ABB's divisions due partly to its involvement in low margin projects. Competition has also forced down prices of products like transformers, also hitting margins. Profitability has improved this year as a result of linking with partners to share the risk on projects and a greater focus on product supply rather than engineering, procurement and construction management services. Nordea (NDA.ST), another shareholder in ABB, said the decision to retain Power Grids meant the company's management had to deliver and improve its performance.     \"Now that they have decided to keep it, it increases pressure on them to show the benefits and grow faster and be more profitable than their competitors,\" John Hernander, portfolio manager at Nordea Asset Management, said. ABB said it was raising its margin outlook for Power Grids to a range of 10 to 14 percent from 2018, from a previous target of 8 to 12 percent. This would be achieved by focusing on higher-margin consultancy services and software. Spiesshofer said he saw potential because the power grids market was growing at around 3 percent per year, but some parts were growing much faster.  Investor AB CEO Johan Forssell said: \"We see no reason to jeopardise the strong momentum, for example, when it comes to cost savings and the turnaround of the systems part of Power Grids, the company enjoys by breaking it up.\" \"Secondly, we believe that ABB is more worth kept together than divided into pieces. We simply believe that the separation costs outweigh the positive aspects of a breakup, and we believe that ABB is a good owner of the business.\" ABB, which announced its plans at an investor day on Tuesday, said the share buy back programme would run from 2017-2019.

The Samsung Group [SAGR.UL], under new de facto leader Jay Y. Lee,  has been keen to strengthen its biopharmaceutical businesses as the smartphones-to-construction business empire hunts for new sources of growth. The offering is primarily aimed at funding an ambitious expansion in production capacity to make BioLogics the world's largest contract manufacturer of biotech medicines. It will also funnel more resources to unlisted unit Samsung Bioepis, which aims to beat rivals to market with its lower-cost copies of some of the world's top-selling biotech drugs called biosimilars.     Kiwoom Securities analyst Kim Joo-yong said prospects for the company looked promising. \"The company specialises in monoclonal antibody drug manufacturing, and almost all the blockbuster drugs such as Humira, Enbrel, Remicade and Herceptin that will see strong biosimilar demand are monoclonal antibody products,\" he said. The offering of 25 percent of the company is expected to consist of a new share issue of 11 million shares and the sale of 5.5 million existing shares by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS). With an indicative pricing range of 113,000 won-136,000 won per share, it is expected to raise as much as 2.25 trillion won ($2 billion). The upper end of the price range would also value BioLogics at 9 trillion won, a market value that could make it South Korea's 30th largest publicly traded company.  BioLogics said 780 billion won of the proceeds will be used  for factory investment, while another 400 billion won will be invested in Bioepis.  Samsung Electronics is the second-largest shareholder in BioLogics after Samsung C&T Corp (028260.KS), the de facto holding company for the Samsung Group [SAGR.UL]    C&T and related shareholders will own 74.93 percent of the company after the listing.

    "text": "Bass Pro Shops said on Monday it will acquire Cabela's Inc (CAB.N) for $5.5 billion, combining two meccas for outdoor enthusiasts, even as the deal may face antitrust scrutiny given that the hunting and fishing retailers overlap in several U.S. states.    The deal, first reported by Reuters, will combine Cabela's 85 stores, which have a stronger U.S. Northwest presence, with Bass Pro's roughly 100 stores that are concentrated in the U.S. Southeast. Their overlap in Texas, Missouri and Kansas will likely raise antitrust concerns.  \"Both Cabela's and Bass Pro Shops used promotions to drive store traffic and market share, especially in contested geographic regions. As a combined entity, we see potential for a more rational promotional environment to emerge, benefiting all industry participants, \"D. A. Davidson & Co said in a research note.  Cabela's had said it would explore a sale last December after pressure from activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, which said the shares were undervalued. Cabela's shares ended up 15 percent at $63.18 on the New York Stock Exchange, close to the $65.50 per share in cash that the deal with Bass Pro values the company. Elliott now stands to make a profit of $419.2 million, nearly double what it paid to buy an 11.1 percent stake in the company, according to regulatory filings. Sydney, Nebraska-based Cabela's and Springfield, Missouri-based Bass Pro have been serving outdoor enthusiasts since their respective foundings in 1961 and 1971.  As the broader industry has struggled to compete with internet retailers such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Bass Pro and Cabela's have been targeting customers seeking a one-stop shop for entertainment, expert advice and shopping. Cabela's has grappled with declining sales of apparel and footwear and has reported same-store sales growth in only one quarter in more than three years. Still, the company maintains a loyal following, with many customers willing to drive miles to shop at stores, as well as dine at its restaurants and visit its shooting ranges. The companies have at times also benefited from their significant hunting-gun businesses, but the industry has seen steep swings in sales amid uncertainty around gun law changes. Both companies are closely associated with their founders, Johnny Morris at Bass Pro and Dick, Mary and Jim Cabela at Cabela's. Dick Cabela died in 2014 and was succeeded by his brother Jim as chairman of Cabela's. Johnny Morris, who still owns a majority of Bass Pro, will be chief executive of the combined company. Cabela's also agreed to sell its credit card business called \"World's Foremost Bank\" to Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N), which will forge a 10-year partnership with Bass Pro to issue credit cards to Cabela's customers.  Bass Pro will finance the acquisition through preferred equity financing commitments of $1.8 billion from Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and $600 million from buyout firm Pamplona Capital Management. JPMMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) advised Bass Pro Shops and Guggenheim Securities advised Cabela's on the deal. "

Forest City, Iowa-based Winnebago, which had a market value of $634 million as of Friday, reported revenue of $977 million for the year ended Aug. 29, 2015. About 37 percent of Winnebago's revenue will come from  towables as a result of the deal  compared with about 10 percent now, Chief Executive Michael Happe said on an analysts' call. \"This combination provides Winnebago with greater overall scale and a more balanced portfolio across its motorized and towables segments,\" Happe said. Winnebago's deliveries of travel trailers jumped 74.2 percent in the third quarter, while fifth-wheel deliveries rose 13.2 percent for total towable deliveries of 1,205 units. Total motorized deliveries rose 12.4 percent to 2,917 units. Grand Design generated revenue of $428 million in the 12-months ended August, for a compounded annual growth rate of more than 80 percent since 2013, Winnebago said. Winnebago said shareholders of Middlebury, Indiana-based Grand Design, which has been in business for less than five years, would own about 14.5 percent of its shares after the close of the deal. Grand Design was founded by three former executives of recreational vehicle maker Thor Industries Inc (THO.N), Don Clark and Ron and Bill Fenech. Winnebago, which also estimated quarterly earnings and revenue ahead of analyst estimates, will pay $395 million in cash and issue $105 million in new shares to Grand Design shareholders. The company said the acquisition was expected to immediately add to profit margins and earnings per share after it closes. Winnebago also forecast revenue of $263.3 million for the fourth quarter, a rise of 4.9 percent from a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had expected revenue of $249.16 million. Adjusted earnings per share were estimated at 49 cents, beating the average estimate of 45 cents. Winnebago will release its results on Oct. 13. J.P. Morgan provided financing and advised Winnebago, while Lindquist & Vennum LLP acted as legal counsel. Baird acted as financial adviser to Grand Design, with Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP acting as legal adviser. "

    "text": "Bai Brands LLC is exploring a sale that it hopes could value the privately held U.S. maker of antioxidant, five-calorie drinks at more than $2 billion including debt, people familiar with the situation said on Monday. The sale process will test the possible interest of beverage companies including Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) in buying upstart beverage brands, as the soft drinks industry grapples with increasingly health-conscious consumers. Bai has hired investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to run an auction and reach out to potential buyers, the sources said.  The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Bai and JPMorgan declined to comment.  Bai, which means \"pure\" in Mandarin Chinese, sweetens its drinks with plant-based ingredients and infuses them with antioxidants from coffee fruit and white tea. It was founded in 2009 by entrepreneur Ben Weiss, who still owns a majority of the company.  The Princeton, New Jersey-based company has focused on expanding distribution and advertising, premiering its first Super Bowl commercial earlier this year.  Last year, drinks company Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc (DPS.N) bought a minority stake in Bai, after signing an earlier distribution deal with the company. Like most major soda companies, Dr Pepper is known to make small investments as it seeks to spot the next brand to capture the attention of consumers. For its part, Coca-Cola has invested in organic juice maker Suja, Honest Tea and Zico Coconut Water. In the case of Honest Tea and Zico, these investments eventually led to an outright acquisition. PepsiCo bought a 90 percent stake in tea drink SoBe in 1999 before buying the entire company a year later.  Still, it is not clear Dr. Pepper will follow in Coke's footsteps. In its conference call after releasing second-quarter 2015 results, Dr. Pepper's CFO, Marty Ellen, voiced wariness of an outright acquisition of Bai. \"To acquire them would be just too expensive, and we are not sure the right thing to do in terms of the amount of money it would actually take to own all these businesses,\" Ellen said. One of the largest acquisitions of an upstart beverage brand was Coke's $4.1 billion purchase of Vitaminwater-maker Glaceau in 2007. Though lauded by analysts at the time as a way for Coke to expand its portfolio of health products, Coke last year agreed to change the wording on labels amid claims the drinks had overstated health benefits.

Investors have poured more than $28 billion into the ride services sector over the past decade, propelling growth at Uber, Lyft Inc, China's Didi Chuxing Technology Co and a host of smaller upstarts, such as Gett. Economists have said there may be scope for even more competition, because ride-sharing services are relatively cheap to start, depend on contract labor with no inherent loyalty or specialized skills, and have free apps that can be downloaded in seconds. Juno is working with investment bank Mizuho Financial Group Inc to find investors, according to the person, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. The person said Juno had previously raised $30 million from companies such as Japan's Rakuten Inc and angel investors.  Chief Executive Officer Talmon Marco declined to comment on the funding, but hinted that Juno had ambitious expansion plans.  \"Moving forward you should definitely expect to see Juno outside New York City, as for where and when it's too early to discuss this,\" Marco said in an interview. Mizuho could not be reached for comment.  To stand out in the crowded ride sharing market and compete with well-funded rivals, Juno distributes equity to drivers every quarter in the form of restricted stock units. These stock units, which vest after a certain amount of time, can be cashed out after a \"liquidity\" event such as a sale of initial public offering, similar to incentives given to employees at technology startups. \"I don't think our drivers are going to make millions, but they will potentially make a nice chunk of money in addition to their ongoing earnings,\" Marco said. Juno only allows drivers to join the company if they already drive for Uber and Lyft and have high ratings. While its prices for riders are comparable to its competitors, it also takes about 10 percent commission from drivers, a smaller cut than Uber or Lyft, Marco said.  When asked about how Juno will make money with a smaller commission, Marco said it spends less to recruit drivers. Juno has brought on 16,000 drivers since starting its service in New York four months ago, Marco said. "

    "date": "Mon Oct 3, 2016 | 3:25 PM EDT",
    "authour": " Additional reporting by Jennifer Ablan in New York and Simon Jessop in London; Editing by Rachel Armstrong, Simon Jessop and Meredith Mazzilli",
    "text": "LONDON/SAN FRANCISCO London-based asset manager Henderson Group (HGGH.L) agreed to buy U.S. rival Janus Capital Group Inc (JNS.N) on Monday in an all-share $6 billion deal to cut costs and boost profits amid growing competition from index funds run by top providers such as Vanguard Group. The combined company, Janus Henderson Global Investors, will manage $320 billion in assets, potentially making it the 39th largest asset manager, globally. Henderson Chief Executive Andrew Formica and Janus CEO Dick Weil will be co-chiefs of the London-headquartered company. If Formica and Weil can tame an operation that will span Denver, London and Japan, their new heft could help thwart expanding regulatory scrutiny on the industry and a move toward low-cost passive investing, analysts said. Shares of both companies surged as they said the deal would boost earnings by more than 10 percent, showing that investors saw the move as a viable alternative to other strategies to defend against passive rivals, such as hiring star managers.  While the merger appeased markets, the combined company will also need to keep major clients and top employees, such as portfolio managers, happy, said T. Neil Bathon, managing partner at asset management consultancy FUSE Research Network LLC. Henderson shares closed 17 percent higher, while Janus shares were last up 13 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. \"We see this as a positive move with complementary asset bases and a very material cost synergy figure,\" analyst Paul McGinnis at Shore Capital said in a client note. MERGER SPECULATION Analysts expect the deal to kick off talk of mergers elsewhere in the industry with companies such as London-based Jupiter (JUP.L) seen as possible targets. Jupiter, whose shares rose 6 percent, did not respond to a request for comment. The merger comes as some mid-sized players in the industry look to gain global scale, streamline operations and diversify in order to protect profits as clients push fees down and regulators ramp up scrutiny of fund managers' practices. Steven Miyao, a president at consultancy DST kasina, said that with half of the top 100 asset managers seeing withdrawals since 2014, the strategic value of a merger today is higher than it will be in the future. \"The combined product line-up will be much more balanced and diverse,\" Formica told a media call, adding Henderson had strength in British and European markets while Janus, which hired Pacific Investment Management Co co-founder Bill Gross as fund manager in 2014, was strong in the United States and Japan. In a statement on Monday, Gross touted the \"greater global scale\" of the combined firms. Janus, which drew acclaim for its U.S. stock funds during the 1990s tech boom, stumbled in the years after. Weil joined in 2010 and despite moves including hiring Gross and buying exchange-traded funds business VelocityShares in 2014, investors pulled $2.2 billion from their funds this year, through August. Henderson posted withdrawals of $1.6 billion over the same timeframe, according to researcher Morningstar Inc (MORN.O). Henderson and Janus shareholders are expected to own approximately 57 percent and 43 percent, respectively, of Janus Henderson Global Investors' shares, with the merger completing in the second quarter of 2017, subject to regulatory approvals. The merger will involve a share exchange in which each Janus share will be exchanged for 4.719 newly issued shares in Henderson, the firms said in a statement. Analysts said the success of the leadership will depend on Formica and Weil working well together. \"It can be a disaster if it's the wrong people, if they don't communicate,\" said Miyao. The firms said they were targeting annual cost savings of at least $110 million, which Henderson chief financial officer Roger Thompson told the media call represented around 10 percent of the combined group's cost base. Cost savings would focus on overlapping functions and areas such as offices and IT, Thompson added. Janus' largest shareholder, Dai-ichi Life (8750.T), supports the deal, the firms said. The combined company will apply for a primary listing in New York, keeping Henderson's Australian listing but delisting in London.  Talks on the merger began at the beginning of the year and were not impacted by the Brexit vote, Formica said. "

    "text": "WASHINGTON The investigative arm of Congress has agreed to examine whether a panel that oversees foreign investment in the United States has the legal powers it needs to keep up with efforts by state-owned firms in Russia and China to buy strategic U.S. companies. The Government Accountability Office said in a letter to lawmakers released on Monday that it would begin the review in about four months once the staff with the needed expertise were cleared of other duties. The letter was dated Sept. 30. The study is being initiated in response to a request on Sept. 15 by 16 members of Congress, who voiced concern that legislation governing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has not been updated enough to ensure the panel can do its job effectively. \"Now is an opportune time for GAO to review what has worked well, and where CFIUS authorities may need to be expanded, especially given the rise in state-owned enterprises and state-controlled enterprises from China and Russia, among other designated countries,\" the lawmakers said in their letter. The letter from the lawmakers noted that foreign investment oversight began as an executive order from the president and was only codified by Congress in response to concerns about foreign ownership of defense industries and ports. The letter said lawmakers were now concerned about recent investments in the telecommunications, media and agriculture sectors that raised questions about \"the degree to which foreign ownership ... may pose a strategic rather than overt national security threat.\" It noted that Chinese companies designated by Beijing as \"state champions\" often benefited from illegal subsidies in order to gain strategic access to markets like the United States. The letter said Congress had raised concerns about China National Chemical Corp's (ChemChina) CNNCC.UL planned $43 billion acquisition of Swiss agricultural seed and pesticides provider Syngenta AG (SYNN.S) and to Dalian Wanda Group's bid for major American movie studios like Legendary Entertainment and Paramount Studios. It said the media acquisitions were particularly concerning because of \"China's efforts to censor topics and exert propaganda controls on American media.\" \"These examples raise serious security questions about what authority CFIUS currently has, or may need to be added, to address these concerns,\" the lawmakers said in their letter.

The European Commission, which halted its scrutiny in early September, will now decide by Feb. 6 whether to approve the deal. Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso confirmed in an email that the companies had submitted important information requested by the EU competition enforcer. Dow Chemical and DuPont said they were confident of securing EU approval. \"We remain focused on working with the European Commission toward closing the transaction by year-end 2016. In the event that the Commission utilises the full allotted time, closing would be expected to occur in the early part of 2017, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of all regulatory approvals,\" the companies said in a statement. They may have to offer concessions after the Commission opened a full investigation into the case in August, concerned that the deal to create the world's largest integrated crop protection and seeds company might reduce competition in these sectors as well as certain petrochemicals. A preliminary offer from the companies was considered inadequate to resolve the Commission's regulatory concerns. The agricultural chemicals industry has seen a wave of consolidation in recent months as companies bulk up to better compete with each other. The Commission is examining another agrichemicals deal involving ChemChina and Syngenta (SYNN.S) while German pharmaceutical and crop chemicals manufacturer Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE) plans to buy U.S. rival and the world's biggest seeds company Monsanto Co (MON.N).

The flotation would be the biggest in Britain so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data. ConvaTec, whose products include wound dressings and colostomy bags, said it expected at least 25 percent of its shares would be freely tradeable following the flotation. It could have a market value of about $7.2 billion. The company will use proceeds from the listing, which is expected in late October or early November, to pay down debt.  Global equity deals are down 30 percent this year, with Britain's surprise vote on June 23 to leave the EU adding to an uncertain global economic outlook..   However, some companies are pressing ahead with UK listings. Spain's Telefonica is looking to list about 30 percent of its British mobile unit, O2, sources close to the matter have told Reuters, while British fitness club chain Pure Gym Group, waste-management firm Biffa and auto parts maker TI Fluid Systems are all working on London listings. ConvaTec Chief Executive Paul Moraviec said the company had been preparing the IPO for the best part of a year and that it had not been delayed by the \"Brexit\" vote.  \"It's a very resilient business ... (the IPO) is taking place as per our plans,\" he said.  ConvaTec, which was sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb to private equity firms for $4.1 billion in 2008, did not say how many shares it would sell, nor the expected price range. reut.rs/2cLERc8  Finance chief Nigel Clerkin said the IPO prospectus would be released in two or three weeks.  ConvaTec added the offering could also allow its owners Nordic Capital, Avista Capital Partners and members of the management team to sell part of their stakes in the company. Christopher Gent, former CEO of mobile phone group Vodafone and former chairman of drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline, has been lined up to be non-executive chairman of the company. ConvaTec, which has more than 9,000 employees and conducts business in more than 100 countries, made $828.9 million of revenue in the six months ended June 30, and adjusted core earnings (EBITDA) of $226.2 million.  It said banks had committed to new debt financing of about $1.8 billion and a $200 million revolving credit facility.

    "text": "SOCHI, Russia Russia said on Friday that it was resuming the shelved privatisation of oil firm Bashneft, in a sign of how anxious the Kremlin is to raise money to fill holes in the budget left by the economic slump. The Bashneft privatisation, the most significant sell-off of Russian state assets in years, had been postponed indefinitely in August. Sources close to the government and the bidding process said at the time the postponement was ordered by the Kremlin to staunch infighting among rival clans over who would be the eventual buyer. But in a U-turn, Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said on Friday steps to resume the privatisation would be taken immediately. He said that Rosneft - the state oil giant whose ambition to acquire Bashneft triggered the infighting - would be free to take part. A spokesman for Rosneft said the company would be lodging a bid. Shuvalov also said the government would proceed immediately with the sale of a minority stake in Rosneft itself, an acquisition of potential interest to international oil majors who covet a share in Russia's massive crude reserves. \"Money is needed urgently,\" a source in the government said, when asked what brought about the government's U-turn on its privatisation plans. A second source in the government said: \"The sale of Bashneft to Rosneft is a done deal.\" BUDGET HOLES Russia is in its second year of economic recession, mainly because of the fall in world prices for crude oil, its principal export. It expects only very moderate growth next year,  The government has struggled to find funds to cover its growing budget deficit. The finance ministry said on Friday the deficit may hit between 3.5 percent and 3.7 percent of gross domestic product this year, compared to a 3 percent estimate a few months ago. Russia's sovereign wealth funds are depleting fast, and its ability to raise debt on international capital markets is limited by financial sanctions imposed on Moscow over its role in the conflict in Ukraine. The government has little scope to cut spending. That could alienate ordinary people whose support President Vladimir Putin will need if, as expected, he seeks re-election in a presidential election in 18 months. \"After further study of the Rosneft and Bashneft privatisation issues by the government, and after a presentation to the president, it was decided to resume the preparations for selling a controlling stake in Bashneft and immediately proceed to prepare for selling a 19.5 percent stake in Rosneft,\" Shuvalov said. Speaking to reporters at a business forum in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, he said the government had reconsidered its position after seeing investor appetite for the two stakes and learning what the potential bidders planned to do if they won. \"According to the assurances that we have received from investment consultants, we hope to receive above 1 trillion roubles ($15.92 billion) from these deals by the end of the current year,\" Shuvalov said. \"The money from the Rosneft privatisation will be counted as budget revenue, and the revenue from the sale of Bashneft (will go on) covering the federal budget deficit,\" he said. On the Bashneft sale, Shuvalov said: \"Rosneft will not be prevented from participating.\" PUTIN'S CHOICE Two years into an economic crisis made worse by the Kremlin's political stand-off with the West, Putin faces a difficult choice. He needs to find ways to plug the holes in the budget and put money into the pocket-books of ordinary Russians who have seen their incomes drop in real terms. But the prescriptions for achieving that goal could also unleash conflict within his own entourage, potentially destabilising his rule. The plan to sell a 50.8 stake in Bashneft had attracted interest from Rosneft, a company headed by Putin's long-standing associate Igor Sechin, and Lukoil, Russia's biggest privately-owned oil company run by billionaire Vagit Alekperov. The interest from Rosneft provoked a storm of protests from pro-market groups within the Kremlin elite who did not see the benefit of one state-owned company acquiring another, according to the sources close to the government and the privatisation process. But in an interview earlier this month, Putin signalled he did not see a problem with Rosneft bidding. \"It looks like Rosneft convinced the government that it is the most suitable suitor to buy Bashneft,\" said Sergei Vakhrameyev, analyst with GL Asset Management. Shuvalov said there has been substantial interest in both the Bashneft and Rosneft sell-offs. He said Bashneft has attracted interest primarily from Russian investors. The planned sale of the 19.5 percent stake in Rosneft, by contrast, was garnering interest mainly from foreign investors, Shuvalov said.

Pakistani shares are trading at an all-time high, helped by an improving economy. The bourse's market capitalization from 558 listed companies is $77 billion. In recent years the main Pakistan bourses were demutualised to weaken the influence of stockbrokers and deepen the investor base. The demutualisation plan required the bourse to find a strategic investor to buy a stake of 15 percent to 40 percent. Pakistani officials said the investor would have to buy at least 15 percent but no higher than 40 percent. If the sale involves a stake of anything in between, the bourse would have to sell the balance to other institutions to meet the 40 percent cap. Japan's Nikkei newspaper first reported the interest of Shanghai Stock Exchange late on Sunday. "

    "text": "A consortium of Bass Pro Shops, Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) private equity arm and Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) is in the lead to acquire U.S. outdoor gear retailer Cabela's Inc (CAB.N), according to people familiar with the matter.  The deal would unite two of the country's largest hunting and fishing retailers and likely face antitrust scrutiny. It would come close to a year after Cabela's said it would explore strategic alternatives, including a potential sale, after coming under pressure from activist fund Elliott Management Corp. The exact price the Bass Pros consortium was offering for Cabela's could not be immediately learned. But the deal is set to value Cabela's well in excess of $4 billion, according to the sources.  The Bass Pro consortium has so far prevailed over a rival bid from private equity firm Sycamore Partners, which had teamed up with U.S. credit card company Synchrony Financial (SYF.N) to make an offer, the people said. While it is still possible that the outcome changes, a deal could be announced as early as this week, the sources said. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Cabela's and Goldman Sachs declined to comment, while Capital One and Bass Pro did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Sidney, Nebraska-based Cabela's and Springfield, Missouri-based Bass Pro have been meccas for outdoor enthusiasts since their respective foundings in 1961 and 1971. As the broader retail industry has struggled to compete with internet retailers such as Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Bass Pro and Cabela's have been targeting customers seeking a one-stop shop for entertainment, expert advice and shopping.  The companies have also at times benefited from their significant hunting-gun businesses, as the industry experiences steep swings in sales amid uncertainty around gun law changes. Both retailers have a foothold across the United States, with overlap in states that include Texas, Missouri and Kansas. Still, Cabela's roughly 80 stores have a stronger Northwest presence, while Bass Pro's approximately 100 stores are more concentrated in the U.S. Northeast.  Reuters reported last week that Bass Pro and Goldman Sachs had teamed up with Capital One, which is interested in the credit card business of Cabela's, which is called World's Foremost Bank. That had nearly 2 million accounts with roughly $5 billion in loans and $502 million in revenue in 2015, according to the company's latest annual report. "

    "text": "Swiss-based ARG International AG, the trading house set up by Glencore Plc's former No. 2 aluminum trader Matt Lucke, is buying a bankrupt smelter in the United States, its first acquisition since its founding nearly three years ago.   Noranda Aluminum Holding Corp said on Friday it sold its 263,000 tonne-per-year New Madrid primary aluminum smelter in Missouri to ARG for $13.7 million in a court-approved auction. Noranda filed for bankruptcy in February after struggling with a sharp downturn in aluminum prices amid a global glut.  Lucke founded ARG six months after leaving Glencore in the summer of 2013 alongside chief Gary Fegel, in a shakeup of the world's biggest aluminum trading desk. Many of Glencore's executives became paper millionaires after the firm's stock market listing in 2011.   At Glencore, Lucke helped run Century Aluminum, which was founded by Glencore and now counts the Swiss trade house and miner as its largest shareholder. Century is a rival of Noranda and operates three smelters in the United States and one in Iceland.   There are few examples in the metals industry of traders not backed by large companies buying production facilities, but it has happened with oil. Neal Shear, who helped build Morgan Stanley's commodity trading business during 25 years at the bank, purchased the aging Come by Chance refinery in Newfoundland alongside veteran trader Kaushik Amin. Lucke's purchase represents a bet on one of the few remaining U.S. smelters as producers struggle with low metal prices, high electricity costs and stiff competition from lower-cost producing regions like the Middle East and China.  The closure of many smelters means the United States, one of the world's biggest consumers of the metal, has to import more, helping to underpin premiums, which have remained fairly firm over the past year.

    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO In the run-up to its initial public offering, cloud computing company Nutanix scrambled to avoid a situation that has increasingly marred technology IPOs: a price that is below the most recent private funding round. After initially pricing shares at $11 to $13, a range that set the company up for a valuation nosedive, Nutanix on Thursday priced shares at $16 apiece. The higher-than-expected price values Nutanix at $2.2 billion, a boost from the $2 billion valuation it received in a 2014 private funding round. Nutanix, which is unprofitable, begins trading Friday on the Nasdaq under the symbol \"NTNX.\"  Nutanix may have squeaked by, but public offerings at a price below the private market valuation, once a rare event, have become quite common, especially for venture-backed companies worth $1 billion or more - the so-called unicorns. Such low-priced IPOs have been often been followed by lackluster public market performance, and can lead to problems with employee morale, recruitment and retention, dealmakers say. Of the 32 technology companies that went public with downrounds since the start of 2012, 53 percent are trading below their IPO price, based on an analysis of data provided by venture capital database PitchBook Inc. Shares of payments company Square Inc, storage firm Box Inc, big data company Hortonworks Inc  and solar energy operator Sunrun Inc, all of which had their valuations slashed, are trading between $5 and $8 below their private market valuation. \"That high valuation can really come back to haunt you,\" said Nate Gallon, a partner with Hogan Lovells law firm. In the most difficult situations, companies that IPO at a lower valuation can trigger an anti-dilution provision called a ratchet, which rewards later investors with more shares at the expense of employees and early investors. Nutanix, which makes technology to improve storage and data center functions, has two ratchets that could have been triggered by a lower valuation on its public offering. In that case, early investors and employees would have been diluted. Nutanix declined to comment. A study by law firm Fenwick & West found that, in 2014, 4 percent of IPOs had a ratchet that was triggered. In 2015, that jumped to 50 percent of deals. The Honest Company, Simplivity and DocuSign are among the other unicorns that are approaching IPO and also have ratchets, according to PitchBook.  \"It's safe to say that almost every (investor) now asks for a ratchet,\" said Dave Peinsipp, a partner at Cooley law firm. Many of those requests come from mutual funds, hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds, which in recent years have joined more late-stage rounds.  \"If the company turns around and does a down IPO, those late investors don’t want to be left holding the bag,\" Gallon said. Some investors argue that, after the IPO, downrounds and ratchets are a distant memory. However, they can also signal deeper problems in the company. \"I don't think you accept ratchets if you have a choice,\" said Hemant Taneja, managing director at General Catalyst Partners. \"What does it say about a management team that overshot its valuation? Some bad decisions made somewhere.\" For its Series B investment round, Nutanix chose Khosla Ventures because the firm offered a valuation of more than $100 million, said Mohit Aron, co-founder of Nutanix who left the company in 2013 to start a new startup, Cohesity. The firm obtained a $1 billion valuation with its Series D, which included a ratchet. Compare that to software company Atlassian, whose valuation jumped 32 percent at its December debut and whose stock is up 44 percent. The profitable company did not raise any venture capital to fund its business operations, dismissing investors who came knocking with offers of bigger valuations. \"What would the point be? It felt that it became this vanity metric,\" said Jay Simons, Atlassian's president. "

    "text": " (Corrects revenue figure in paragraph 9 to $445 million, not $351 million) By Lauren Hirsch Nutanix Inc said on Thursday it sold a more than expected 14.87 million shares priced at $16, valuing the company at more than $2 billion. San Jose, California-based Nutanix's share price exceeds the $13.40 value last placed on its shares in a 2014 funding round, an upgrade encouraging for the many unprofitable technology companies that, like Nutanix, have been weary of testing public market valuations.  Nutanix sold 14.87 million shares on Thursday, more than the anticipated 14 million. Its $16 IPO price was above its indicated range of $13 and $15. \"Nutanix is a very important deal for technology, because as a deal that will be above its private valuation. It is a sign that there's an appetite for a high-growth company that doesn't yet have earnings,\" said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital, which manages IPO-focused exchange traded funds. Nutanix, which is unprofitable, was valued at $2 billion after its last financing round and delayed its expected January IPO amid market jitters that froze much of the market for technology IPOs. Many technology companies in Silicon Valley, which has been awash in private funding for the past several years, have enjoyed lofty valuations without being profitable. It has been uncertain whether these companies could beat or even replicate such valuations in the public market. In the latter half of last year into this spring, businesses such as Square Inc had so-called \"down-round IPOs\", public offerings which valued the company at less than their last private fundraise.  While late-stage investors in these companies can ensure financial protection in such down-rounds through the use of so-called \"ratchets\", they can hurt company morale and lower the financial return for earlier stage investors. A recent string of technology IPOs has demonstrated growing investor favor for technology companies. Shares of software company Twilio Inc, which is not profitable are now trading nearly four times above their June IPO price. Nutanix had revenue of $445 million in its 2016 fiscal year and reported a net loss of $168 million. It acquired two small cloud software acquisitions this summer, PernixData and Calm.io. Nutanix will use proceeds from the IPO for general corporate purposes and potentially for acquisitions.  It plans to list Friday on Nasdaq under the symbol \"NTNX\" Goldman Sachs Group, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co and RBC Capital Markets are among underwriters for the offering.  "

    "text": "NEW YORK MediaNews Group Inc, one of the largest U.S. newspaper companies, said on Friday it plans to nominate seven directors to replace the board of Monster Worldwide Inc (MWW.N), stepping up a battle against the proposed sale of the online jobs site. The fight presents a unique case whereby a private company is proposing to overthrow a public company's entire board through a proxy fight, a move more often associated with activist hedge funds.  Monster, based in Weston, Massachusetts, agreed in August to a $429 million acquisition offer from Dutch staffing group Randstad (RAND.AS). The all-cash offer from Randstad, the world's second-largest staffing company, is part of its effort to expand into the United States and into online recruiting. Ten days after the announcement of that deal, MediaNews said it had bought an 11.6 percent stake in Monster and that it opposed the Randstad acquisition.  MediaNews repeated its concerns about the deal on Friday.  \"We have significant concerns about the flawed and unorganized sale process that led to the current deal with Randstad,\" MediaNews said on Friday. Monster Chief Executive Officer Tim Yates said in a statement that MediaNews Group is trying to derail the Randstad deal and take control of the company without paying a premium. Monster's board recommends that shareholders tender their shares to Randstad, \"which provides stockholders immediate and certain value,\" Yates said. MediaNews, whose 67 daily newspapers include the San Jose (California) Mercury News and the Lowell (Massachusetts) Sun, nominated seven directors, including Daniel Dienst, former chief executive of Martha Stewart Omnimedia, who MediaNews said it would install as Monster's CEO if its proposed slate of directors wins. Monster's annual meeting has already been held, so MediaNews is launching a consent solicitation, meaning it needs to get the support of more than 50 percent of Monster's outstanding shareholders before it can proceed with a special vote for its seven nominees.   MediaNews said in August that Monster should remain independent and boost its share price through cost cuts, the sale of assets and by adjusting its strategy.  Monster has called the MediaNews case against the Randstad offer \"flawed and uninformed.\" Last week, Randstad extended the deadline for its offer to Oct. 28.   \"Randstad has full confidence in its proposed transaction to acquire Monster Worldwide, Inc,\" the company said on Friday. \"We believe our terms deliver substantial and certain value for MWW shareholders.\" "

    "authour": " Reporting by Lauren Hirsch and Greg Roumeliotis in New York; Additional reporting by Sophie Sassard in London; Editing by Bill Rigby",
    "text": "The value of announced mergers and acquisitions (M&A) worldwide fell 27 percent year-on-year to $753 billion in the third quarter of 2016, as apprehension among corporate executives about overpaying prevented a repeat of last year's deal-making frenzy. The preliminary Thomson Reuters M&A data shows the euphoria that drove merger mania in 2015 has subsided. While M&A activity remains robust, dealmakers said companies are being more selective in their decisions to do deals. \"With price-to-earnings multiples at historic highs, deals are more likely to happen when there is lower growth in a sector, high potential for synergies, and potential acquirers enjoy a healthy stock price,\" said Paul Parker, chairman of global M&A at Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N. The stock market is hovering at record highs, while the S&P 500 Index's price-to-earnings ratio is at its highest level since the 2008 financial crisis. Combined with uncertainty over the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy on interest rates, companies have become more cautious when it comes to M&A. \"It does get down to high prices. I think most of last year and the two years prior, even if it was priced high it was OK... Now, it had better be for a good growth profile,\" said Marc-Anthony Hourihan, co-head of M&A for the Americas at UBS Group AG UBSG.S. This year's largest deal so far was clinched in the third quarter; German drug and crop chemical maker Bayer AG's BAYGn.DE $66 billion takeover of U.S. seeds company Monsanto Co MON.N is also the biggest all-cash deal on record. Some of the other big deals this quarter included Enbridge Inc's ENB.TO $28 billion acquisition of Spectra Energy Corp SE.N to create the largest North American energy infrastructure company, and Softbank Group Corp's 9984.T $32 billion acquisition of British semiconductor maker ARM Holdings Plc. \"The strategic consolidation activity occurring has resulted in many CEOs and boards across sectors saying 'I don’t want to be left out, I don’t want to be the last mover, because then there will be nothing left to do and I may be disadvantaged',\" said Patrick Ramsey, co-head of global M&A, Bank of America Corp BAC.N. \"This will continue to be a driver of both transformative mergers and sizeable bolt-on acquisition activity,\" Ramsey added. Another factor that has weighed on M&A this year, dealmakers said, is the United States and several other countries flexing their antitrust muscles and seeking to crack down on deals that aid tax avoidance or risk harming national security. BIG PREMIUM An exception to the heightened price awareness is the pharmaceutical sector. Drug companies continue to be willing to pay high premiums to buy new products, rather than devote their resources to risky drug development. In August, Pfizer Inc PFE.N announced a $14 billion deal to acquire cancer drug maker Medivation Inc MDVN.O, at an 118 percent premium to Medivation's undisturbed share price. \"Valuations in pharmaceutical companies may not be objectively attractive. You're just dealing with simple reality that many companies need to fill the pipeline of products to supplement what they are able to produce organically,\" said Daniel Wolf, an M&A partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis. This quarter, the U.S. had its largest amount of inbound global deals in more than a decade, led by buyers in Europe, Canada and Asia, as the nation's economy continued to be attractive despite its challenges. In July, for example, French yogurt company Danone SA DANO.PA said it would double the size of its U.S. business by buying organic foods producer WhiteWave Foods Co WWAV.N for $10.4 billion in its largest acquisition since 2007. \"Once-cautious executives are now looking for growth outside their home market, partly because there is a certain degree of frustration with the lack of economic growth in the region. That makes it even more pressing to look for growth elsewhere and the U.S. remains a logical destination,” said Dietrich Becker, a partner at investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners LP. That said, Softbank's deal for ARM shows that some companies have seen the turmoil created by Britain's vote to leave the European Union as a buying opportunity. Outbound M&A from China continues to be a key driver of deals. China has accumulated $159 billion in outbound M&A so far this year, topping 2015's full-year record of $107 billion. "

    "text": "WASHINGTON The judge who will rule on whether the government may stop health insurer Anthem (ANTM.N) from buying competitor Cigna (CI.N) said Friday that she was considering splitting the trial into phases. Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said that she was mulling hearing separately about the effect of the merger on the national market in one phase and on local markets in a second phase with a potential decision after the first set of arguments. The Justice Department argues that the deal would reduce competition and raise prices for consumers. \"My initial reaction is that it's better,\" said Christopher Curran, who is arguing the case for Anthem. \"If we're going to lose and we lose quickly, that's better for everyone.\" The trial in the case is to begin on Nov. 21, with a conclusion by Dec. 30. The government also alleged that the merger would give the new, combined company too much power to set the rates of health care providers, essentially a monopsony case. That could be argued with either phase, said Jon Jacobs, who argued for the Justice Department. \"I'm going to think about this. I think it's more complicated than I had thought,\" the judge said, adding that she still believed it would be beneficial to hear arguments in phases. Cigna's lawyer, Charles Rule, asked if he would be allowed to object to questions from Anthem, referring to the contentious relationship between the two companies. \"I'm not sure exactly what will come up,\" said Rule. \"(But) there may need to be an objection.\" The judge responded with surprise. \"I'm not going to tell you that it's prohibited but I find it highly extraordinary,\" she said. Anthem had sought a ruling by the end of the year on whether the government could stop the deal because the insurer said it needed time to wrap up merger reviews by state insurance commissioners by April 30, a deadline the companies set to complete the deal. Anthem has said failure to meet the deadline could prompt Cigna to pull out. The Justice Department filed lawsuits on July 21 asking a federal court to stop two huge healthcare mergers: Anthem's planned $45 billion purchase of Cigna, as well as Aetna Inc's (AET.N) $33 billion planned acquisition of Humana (HUM.N). The trial on the Aetna deal is set for Dec. 5. If both mergers go through, No. 1 U.S. insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) would rank second after Anthem. Aetna would be No. 3. "

    "text": "NEW YORK U.S. syndicated loan financing of $1.326 trillion in the first nine months of 2016 was 11 percent lower than the same period last year and the lowest since 2012 as M&A activity dropped and opportunistic refinancings prevailed while interest rates stayed low with the U.S. elections pending. The $372 billion of loans issued in the third quarter was 31 percent below the same time last year and down 38 percent from second quarter volume, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data.  Looming year-end uncertainties including the elections and Federal Reserve policy actions are expected to keep mergers and acquisitions subdued, investors and bankers said. Leveraged buyout business, meanwhile, remains contained by regulations limiting the amount of debt in those deals. Leveraged lending is down 11 percent in the year to date at around $555 billion, while investment grade lending is off 7 percent at about $580 billion. A gradual increase is seen for M&A financing, which totals about $320 billion so far this year and is down 20 percent from the same nine months of last year. Third quarter financing to back mergers and acquisitions fell 40 percent from the prior quarter.  The slowly growing U.S. economy argues for expansion via mergers or leveraged buyouts, and software and healthcare remain prime sectors for these deals, investors and bankers said.  “If you don’t have huge actual growth in the economy, M&A and LBOs are a way to create some external rather than organic growth, financed at a pretty cheap level over the next six to 12 months,” said Jean-Philippe Levilain, global head of leveraged loans at AXA Investment Managers. In the meantime, lower volatility and the Federal Reserve’s September decision to keep interest rates on hold opened the window wide for companies looking to cut borrowing costs, extend maturities and adjust other terms on existing deals with aggressive refinancings.  In keeping with this year’s trend, these issuer friendly transactions accounted for roughly two-thirds of total loan volume.  The quarter’s deal volume was dominated by refinancing while spotted with M&A and leveraged buyouts, but for the first time in several years, escalated after Labor Day and sustained a solid pace throughout September, Levilain said. “Refinancing is the preferred use of proceeds, but we are seeing a good mix of deals and that’s what we expect for next quarter,” he said. TURNING NEGATIVES INTO A POSITIVE While supply is lower than a year ago, investors are ready to buy floating-rate loans given the near-term prospects of the second Fed rate hike in a decade while a vast swath of global debt carries negative yields.  The Fed is widely seen hiking rates in December, for the first time in a year. Globally, negative-yielding government bonds neared $11 trillion in mid-September, Fitch Ratings said last week. Low or negative yields are a plus for higher yielding assets, including U.S. loans.  Three-year leveraged loans yielded an average 5.35 percent in the third quarter, roughly the same as a year earlier though down from the recent peak of 6.53 percent in the first quarter, Thomson Reuters LPC data show. In one sign of investor appetite, retail accounts have been net buyers of bank loan funds for nine straight weeks. This is the longest running inflow streak in more than two years, according to Lipper data.  "

    "text": "LONDON Global equity fundraising rose in the third quarter, Thomson Reuters data showed on Friday, but failed to make up for the sharp slowdown of the first half of 2016, when volatile markets deterred listings. Equity fundraising worldwide fell 30 percent to $463.5 billion in the year to date. Bankers said a robust pipeline of deals may improve conditions over the next two quarters but equity fundraising is unlikely to reach levels seen last year.  Money raised from flotations, or initial public offerings (IPOs), fell more than a third to $79.2 billion in the first three quarters, the slowest such period since 2009, Thomson Reuters Equity Capital Markets (ECM) data showed. Bankers said deals which could not be done earlier in the year because of choppy market conditions saw their window in the last few months, resulting in an unseasonably busy third quarter. Global ECM volumes rose 23 percent to 166.1 billion in the third quarter, compared to the same period in 2015.  Achintya Mangla, head of EMEA ECM at JP Morgan in London, said investors had become more comfortable with Britain's decision to leave the European Union, and with the outlook of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the stable conditions across Europe.  \"It's not a bull market but it's a constructive market with a lot of liquidity which investors are keen to deploy into the right equity story and at the right price,\" he said. \"It's not a market you can take for granted. Volatility could return and investors will monitor the trading performance of deals.\" Global markets .WORLD were on track for their biggest quarter-on-quarter boost for five quarters, compared to a decline in the first three months of the year.  Worries about a slowdown in China, the world's second biggest economy, and falling oil prices which hit $27 a barrel in January, made for a volatile first quarter with investors wavering between calm and panic. In June the British vote to leave the EU heaped on additional volatility and spooked some companies hoping to tap equity markets.  Bankers said some listings which could not be done then were postponed to August and September.  Professional services firm EY saw a healthy pipeline of deals for the remainder of the year and the start of 2017, with improved political stability and greater clarity over Brexit  negotiations holding the key to a pickup in IPO activity. LUKEWARM ISSUE     In the final days of the quarter, a $7.4 billion IPO of Postal Savings Bank of China (1658.HK) made a flat debut in Hong Kong as worries over the health of the banking sector squeezed retail demand. The IPO was the biggest in two years and drove a more than five-fold increase in the value of IPOs in China in the quarter. Shares in Dutch online food-ordering site Takeaway.com TKWY_w.AS made their debut on Friday and were up more than 6  percent compared with their issue price. The demand for shares in Nets (NETS.CO), issuer of Denmark's most used debit card, exceeded expectations last week, but it closed 8 percent below its offer price on Friday.  The tech business was valued at $4.5 billion, nearly double what Advent International, Bain Capital and pension fund ATP paid for it two years ago. Bolstered in part by a $4.1 billion convertible bond issue for Vodafone (VOD.L) in February, JP Morgan (JPM.N) came out top of the league table for equity offerings. It was also the top bookrunner on IPOs globally.   \"Markets are constructive right now and investors are willing to put money to work but they are selective and disciplined on price. There are events on the horizon [U.S election for example] which could cause market volatility so we would advise to clients to do deals now if it makes sense,\" JP Morgan's Mangla said. An IPO of British mobile unit O2 by Spain's Telefonica (TEF.MC) is expected to be one of the biggest listings in London later this year, with the group expected to take advantage of the relative market calm following the Brexit vote. The firm has hired UBS (UBSG.S), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Barclays (BARC.L) as global coordinators for the listing, which could value O2 at about 10 billion pounds ($13 billion). Bankers said they had a robust stream of equity raising deals coming up, but no bank was likely to see the business pipeline of 2014-15, when a season of private equity exits helped keep ECM bankers busy. \"The pipeline is expected to improve, even taking in to consideration macro events including the (2017) German and French elections, and likely periods of episodic volatility,\" said Ed Sankey, Co-Head EMEA ECM & Global Head of Equity Syndicate at Deutsche Bank. With the U.S. elections in November, a referendum on constitutional reform in Italy in December and the triggering of Britain's formal divorce proceedings from the EU expected early next year, there remain opportunities for market swings. But Gareth McCartney, EMEA Head of Equity Syndicate at UBS, said there was more clarity with respect to macroeconomic events, with some questions critical to geopolitical and market stability about to be addressed. \"We are now in a sweet spot where we have visibility on the macro front, ahead of the upcoming U.S. elections and clarity on the Italy referendum. We are in the middle of the best part of the year for executing transactions,\" he said. \"It will be a slow burn, a lower volatility environment, which should allow for greater issuance.\" "

    "text": "FRANKFURT Commerzbank (CBKG.DE) aims to add 2 million retail and small business customers over the next four years, part of a revamp to boost earnings that will also see it cut thousands of jobs. Germany's second biggest lender detailed its new strategy on Friday as the chief executive of Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) sought to reassure staff and investors that the country's largest bank remained robust after fears over its stability sent tremors through financial markets. Commerzbank's new customer drive will be based on greater use of multi-channel banking and products such as a digital loan platform and robot-assisted asset management advice. \"We've started to see movement in market share that appeared fixed in cement over decades and that is our opportunity,\" Chief Executive Martin Zielke told a news conference, adding that Commerzbank's 1000-branch strong network would capture clients abandoned as rival banks reduce their geographical presence. Deutsche Bank and HVB (CRDI.MI) have been closing branches in their own efforts to boost earnings. Commerzbank's target is double the previous goal for net new retail customers over the last four years, which it achieved. It also aims to boost its market share among small businesses to 8 percent from 5 percent, helping to generate revenue growth for the retail and small business segment of at least 1.1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) by the end of 2020. Negative European Central Bank (ECB) interest rates are limiting the scope to boost revenue in a fiercely competitive German banking market, leaving Commerzbank little choice but to focus heavily on cost cuts. Zielke, who has been working on the plan since taking the helm in May, said he intends to generate 1.1 billion euros in savings through improved efficiency. His plan aims to cut the ratio of costs-to-income, a key measure of profitability, to below 66 percent, while boosting return on tangible equity to more than 6 percent over the period. The cost-income ratio currently stands at 83 percent and return on tangible equity at 3 percent, credit rating agency Fitch calculated, underscoring Zielke's ambitious path ahead. \"We see substantial execution risk, primarily in defending its corporate market position,\" Fitch said in a note, adding that cutting jobs were likely to involve lengthy negotiations. Commerzbank had outlined its plan on Thursday, including the nearly 10,000 job cuts, more than a fifth of its workforce. Zielke said he would try to avoid compulsory redundancies. The labor representatives on Commerzbank's supervisory board said in a statement they supported building up the bank's core business and the need for digital operations but added that the size of the job cuts was not justified. Mark Roach, one of those members, told Der Spiegel magazine the actual number of employees affected by the job cuts could be more than 12,000, because of the bank's many part time workers. Shares in Commerzbank were 3.5 percent lower at 1430 GMT, lagging a 0.7 percent drop in the STOXX Europe 600 banking index .SX7P. "

    "text": "PARIS Airbus Group (AIR.PA) said on Friday it would merge with its planemaking unit, strip out bureaucracy and simplify its brand, marking a break with its complex corporate roots as it prepares for tougher expected competition. Europe's largest aerospace group will be renamed \"Airbus\" after its core planemaking brand under the shake-up, the latest piece of corporate tinkering since it emerged from a cluster of French, German and Spanish aerospace interests in 2000. Airbus confirmed the promotion of Fabrice Bregier to the new role of chief operating officer for the whole group, with overall responsibility for reshaping digital operations as well as for the global supply chain and quality. He will continue to carry out his existing job in charge of the planemaking business, renamed Airbus Commercial Aircraft. \"We are bringing Team Airbus closer together, recognizing that our commercial aircraft division is by far the largest contributor to our company's revenues and financials,\" Chief Executive Tom Enders said in a statement. The company curbed the influence of French and German governments in 2013 and adopted its best-known jetmaking brand a year later by renaming itself Airbus Group, but left in place an  overlapping structure and confusion over which Airbus was which. People familiar with the plans said earlier that this distinction would now disappear as the vehicle for the original merger, known as Airbus Group SAS, and the planemaker, Airbus SAS, merge into a single company based in Toulouse under a sole chief executive, German-born Enders. Both are currently subsidiaries of the listed entity, Airbus Group SE, which is based in the Netherlands. Enders has promised to bring new digital thinking into production, development and support to speed decision-making and prepare for future competition across the group's products which range from aircraft to satellites and defense systems. He told staff in a letter last week the changes would result in consolidation and cost-reductions at the top of the company. French labor unions ranging from Force Ouvriere to the CGT, CFDT and CFE-CGC said they feared possible job cuts.  Force Ouvriere said in a statement it would \"watch all the components of this restructuring, notably its social impact\" CGT official Xavier Petrachi told Reuters: \"We do not know yet the scope of this restructuring. Will it be limited to the support functions of Airbus Group and of Airbus SAS or will it impact the structures of Airbus Operations and entities of the helicopters and defense and space units ?\" The heads of the company's two other divisions, helicopters boss Guillaume Faury and defense and space chief Dirk Hoke, are expected to assume additional group-wide roles to help drive through Enders' so-called \"digital transformation\" project.  The company said these units would benefit from reduced costs due to the internal merger, which will take effect in January. It did not provide any financial details. "

    "date": "Fri Sep 30, 2016 | 9:30 AM EDT",
    "authour": " Reporting by Alasdair Reilly & Hannah Brenton; Editing by Tessa Walsh",
    "text": "LONDON Syndicated lending in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the first nine months of 2016 was US$590bn, the lowest total for four years, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data, as demand for loans remained subdued amid political and economic volatility. The end of the main refinancing cycle and wider uncertainty - including Britain’s shock vote to leave the European Union in June and the upcoming presidential election in the US - has kept many borrowers away from the loan market, despite high levels of market liquidity and the ultra low loan pricing on offer.  Loan volume was 22% lower at the end of the third quarter than the same period of 2015 as refinancing -- the traditional driver of EMEA lending -- plunged 38% to US$276bn. Third quarter volume was also 32% lower year-on-year at US$150bn, compared to US$220.5bn a year earlier as activity subsided over the summer after the Brexit vote.    Most European companies have already refinanced in the last couple of years at attractively low rates and bankers are not expecting an upturn before the end of the year.   “I do not see the figures improving at year-end. Once you are behind it is incredibly difficult to catch up. You would need a lot of big corporate refinancing to make up the lost ground and those are simply too few and far between,” a senior banker said. Meanwhile, M&A financing was flat on last year at US$142bn as acquisition activity remained patchy, although a clutch of multi-billion M&A financings - including a US$57bn bridge loan backing Bayer’s (BAYGn.DE) acquisition of Monsanto - could boost fourth quarter volumes. The third quarter did see several multi-billion event-driven loans completed, the largest of which was a US$13.1bn backing France’s Danone’s (DANO.PA) acquisition of US organic foods producer WhiteWave Foods.  German conventional generation and energy trading business Uniper closed a €4.5bn loan in July backing its spin-off from E.ON (EONGn.DE), and South African retail group Steinhoff (SHFFp.J) closed a US$4bn loan backing its takeover of US mattress seller Mattress Firm in early September. Although levels of M&A activity are not enough to fill the gap left by the lack of refinancing, event driven deals provide banks with greater value as they look to secure ancillary business such as related capital market takeouts. “Regardless of overall market volumes, it is these new money transactions that really count,” a second banker said.  “We are seeing a nice mix of things out there at the moment. Cross-over financings, loans backing spin-offs and IPO financings, as well as deals like Bayer, which will help not only fill out volume but also supply quality.” LEV LOANS SLUGGISH  The European leveraged loan market’s sluggish year continued in the third quarter, bringing year-to-date volume to its lowest point since 2012 as a lack of supply created favorable borrowing conditions.   Leverage loan volume of US$38bn in the third quarter contributed to a 32% slump in volume to US$115bn for the first nine months, compared to US$170bn in the same period of 2015. Investors faced a thin supply of new loans over the summer. Leveraged M&A loans were 29% lower at US$49bn in the first three quarters compared to US$69.6bn a year earlier, while refinancings showed a 40% decline in the same period to US$53bn from US$89.4bn. With only a handful of auction processes in the works for the fourth quarter, bankers do not expect M&A-driven issuance to pick up substantially before year-end, putting bank revenues under pressure.  “From an overall deal perspective we think it’s going to be a down year,” a third loan banker said. “If you do the maths in terms of the number of processes coming through, there aren’t that many.” The lack of prospective supply is exacerbating a borrowers' market as leveraged loans continue to look attractive to  investors hunting for yield. The weight of demand has pushed secondary market levels to an average bid of 100.24% of face value on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data.  Favorable market conditions prompted a wave of opportunistic deals which hit the market in early September,  including refinancings, repricings and dividend recapitalizations – which show no signs of abating.  “It’s tough, it’s very tough,” said one loan investor. “Conditions are very good for issuance, if you’re thinking about it, you will do it.” After nine months BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) tops the EMEA syndicated loan bookrunner league table with a US$28.69bn market share and 147 deals. UniCredit (CRDI.MI) claims second place with US$26.77bn and 128 deals, while JP Morgan (JPM.N) is third with US$25.11bn and 48 deals. "

    "text": "PRAGUE Avast Software, maker of the world's most popular computer antivirus program, will need a year to absorb its $1.3 billion buy of rival AVG but may seek further acquisitions before an expected flotation, its chief executive said in an interview. Prague-based Avast closed its purchase on Friday of AVG Technologies, another software firm with Czech roots specializing in consumer security. The combined company will have over 400 million users and 40 percent of the consumer computer market outside of China.  While Avast will delist AVG shares, it has its own plans to eventually offer shares, maybe as soon as 2019. Before that, it must fully integrate AVG and will then look at mid-tier acquisitions for its push into mobile and, possibly, to expand its small- and medium-sized business offering. \"We have to digest AVG first and that is going to take us pretty much all of 2017 to really integrate. Then we will look at expanding the business after that,\" Avast CEO Vincent Steckler said. \"If we do something else to bulk up the company it would be substantive and I expect it would be in the hundreds (of millions of dollars).\" Avast had long sought to tie up with AVG, which also started around 25 years ago as then-Czechoslovakia shifted to free markets after decades of communism. The new Avast, which will still offer both brands, will have combined revenue of more than $700 million in 2016. The bulk of that will come from its consumer products, but it wants to grow its income from the mobile and business sectors.  The tie-up, the biggest deal in company history, will give Avast heft to compete with the likes of Microsoft or McAfee, part of Intel Security. Steckler said the company would avoid recognizable names when it seeks acquisitions in future but said potential targets would be bigger than start-ups. He said future deals would look at growing the company's mobile business outside the United States, where it already has a good presence. On the business side, it could concentrate on adding network security solutions. "

    "text": "SINGAPORE/HONG KONG France's AXA (AXAF.PA) and Germany's Allianz SE (ALVG.DE) have advanced to the second stage of bidding for a Standard Chartered (STAN.L) deal that would enable the sale of general insurance products through the bank's Asian branches, people familiar with the matter said. A unit of Japan's MS&AD (8725.T), Standard Chartered's existing general insurance partner, has also progressed to the next round, one of the people added. It was not immediately clear if other suitors who had made initial bids were through to the second round, which included another Japanese insurer. The 15-year deal could be worth around $300 million, calculated on the basis of an upfront payment to access the branch network and the net present value of future commissions and deferred payments, said the people, who declined to be identified because the details of the deal were not public. Standard Chartered will decide on a preferred bidder for the so-called bancassurance deal after the second round, they said. Representatives for Standard Chartered, Allianz, AXA and MS&AD declined comment. A source with direct knowledge of the matter said Standard Chartered may not necessarily choose the bidder with the highest price as the bank needs a partner who would help it build up a retail business.     The bancassurance model - as opposed to the traditional agency model - is lucrative for banks because global insurers are willing to pay hefty fees for access to lenders' branch networks and for exposure to a rapidly growing middle class in emerging markets. Asia has seen several large bank distribution deals for life insurance in the past three years and transactions for non-life insurance are also heating up.      In June, Malaysia lender CIMB (CIMB.KL) entered a similar agreement with insurer Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Holdings Inc (8630.T) while Tokio Marine Holdings Inc (8766.T) is in exclusive talks to buy RHB Bank's (RHBC.KL) general insurance unit.     The insurance market in Asia is expected to grow 6-7  percent per year, AXA said this year.     AXA is aiming to boost its customer base from 20 million to over 100 million by 2030 and plans to increase underlying earnings to 900 million euros in 2020 from 551 million euros in 2015. Allianz has been expanding its presence in Asia. In June it completed a deal to acquire a 51 percent stake in PNB life in Philippines and signed a 15-year bancassurance deal with Philippine National Bank (PNB.PS). "

    "text": "Online trading company IG Group Holdings Plc (IGG.L) said it had agreed to buy news and research portal DailyFX and its associated assets from U.S. retail broker FXCM Inc (FXCM.O) for $40 million. IG Group said the deal, which is expected to close by the end of October, would add about 5 million pounds ($6 million) to ongoing operating costs annually and add to earnings from IG's 2018 financial year. The British company also said it expected to account for the purchase price at a constant rate spread over 10 years.  Analysts said this meant total costs of 8 million pounds, after adding 3 million pounds in amortization annually. IG Group, which has over 152,600 active clients according to its website, said the deal would \"significantly enhance\" its ability to bring on new clients and improve the retention rates of  current clients. \"Our discussions with IG this morning indicate that IG is not buying a revenue stream but instead a client recruitment engine,\" RBC analysts said. \"While client recruitment and retainment are positives, this acquisition does add to an already rapidly increasing cost base,\" the analysts added. IG Group said this month that financial markets had become \"increasingly subdued\" in the two months after Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union, presenting clients with limited trading opportunities. Upon completion, the DailyFX business along with its web domains, source code, content and 34 employees will be transferred to IG, FXCM said. Assuming a cost base of 8 million pounds and revenue per client of 2,000 pounds, DailyFX needs to add 4,000 customers every year to break even, Barclays analysts said.  FXCM, which is the largest U.S. retail broker, with about 200,000 customers worldwide and 88,000 in the United States, said it would use the proceeds from the sale to repay debt owed to Leucadia National Corp (LUK.N).

The deal would help diversify Qualcomm's business and make it a bigger supplier to the automotive industry. Talks are in the early stages and NXP may entertain other offers, should they emerge, according to one of the sources.   An agreement with Qualcomm could be struck in the next two to three months, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported news of the talks.  Representatives for Netherlands-based NXP and San Diego-based Qualcomm declined to comment.  NXP shares rose 16.9 percent to close at $96.12 on Thursday, while Qualcomm's rose 6.3 percent to $67.45.  NXP closed a nearly $12 billion deal to buy U.S.-based Freescale Semiconductor last December, creating the world's top maker of automotive electronics and doubling the percentage of its auto-related revenue to 40 percent. It could also attract interest from other large semiconductor companies such as Broadcom and Texas Instruments Inc (TXN.O), analysts have said.  Qualcomm, which supplies Android smartphone makers and Apple Inc (AAPL.O), has been dealing with slowing smartphone sales and stiff competition from Chinese and Taiwanese rivals. Qualcomm has so far sat out the transformative consolidation sweeping the industry, which has seen mega-deals such as Avago (AVGO.O)  buying Broadcom for $37 billion last year.  Qualcomm gets the bulk of its revenue from chip sales but most of its profit comes from wireless patents it licenses to the mobile industry. It explored a plan to break up its chip business from its patent licensing unit after pressure from activist investor Jana Partners but decided to remain whole.  Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh said that the deal would give Qualcomm a roadmap for the next decade while moving away from a maturing handset market and toward the faster growing opportunity in automotives.  Qualcomm was ranked third in terms of revenue among global semiconductor companies in 2015, while NXP ranked No. 7, according to research firm IHS.  RBC analyst Amit Daryanani said the potential deal would be accretive to Qualcomm, which could also use offshore cash. \"Assuming a reasonable valuation is paid, this would be an attractive acquisition for Qualcomm and a good use of $30 billion in cash Qualcomm currently has on their balance sheet,\" Daryanani said. NXP has a market value of about $28.5 billion, while Qualcomm's is about $93 billion. "

    "text": "PARIS Airbus Group SAS is likely to merge with its main planemaking unit, Airbus SAS, as part of a corporate restructuring being finalised on Thursday, people familiar with the matter said. The restructuring aims to simplify a top-heavy corporate structure inherited from the group's complex origins as a group of separate aerospace firms, and consolidate its position as a European aerospace champion anchored in Toulouse, France. A spokesman for Airbus Group (AIR.PA) declined to comment. The merger of the operational parent and jetmaking unit into one company called \"Airbus\" rekindles an idea debated over a decade ago, but abandoned amid disagreements among former managers and shareholders aligned with competing French and German interests. The group changed its name from EADS and overhauled its governance in 2013-14, limiting the influence of French and German minority state shareholdings and granting more independence to management under German-born Chief Executive Tom Enders. But it remained saddled with separate bureaucracies and confusion over the brand, with the planemaking unit keeping the core \"Airbus\" identity and no fewer than five CEOs spread across the parent company, three units and one geographical division. Analysts say the reorganisation will reinforce Enders as sole CEO while removing any ambiguity over his successor, as planemaking boss Fabrice Bregier steps up to become chief operating officer of the whole company. The Frenchman will continue to run jetmaking activities, which will be solely a division rather than separate entity. The impact on jobs was unclear but Enders has pledged to avoid \"massive\" redundancies among the 137,000 staff. Nor was it immediately clear how the new structure would fit under the company's publicly listed legal parent, Airbus Group SE, based in the Netherlands. Shares in Europe's rival to Boeing (BA.N) rose 1 percent. Highlighting its growing international focus, the decision to streamline the European firm was being thrashed out at a board meeting at a new Airbus plant in Mobile, Alabama. Due to be announced as French engineer Alstom remains mired in a political storm over a factory closure, the reorganisation will heavily talk up new digital methods, something Enders hopes will make aerospace stand out from declining industrial sectors. Sources said on Wednesday the company's defence chief, Siemens veteran Dirk Hoke, would take a lead role in spreading digital processes and services across the group.

Privately held National Amusements, which owns 80 percent of voting shares of both companies, said in a letter to both companies' boards that a merger would \"offer substantial synergies that would allow the combined company to respond even more aggressively and effectively to the challenges of the changing entertainment and media landscape.\" CBS shares closed 0.8 percent higher at $54.57 on Thursday and Viacom shares rose 3.3 percent to end at $37.77   When Redstone split CBS from Viacom 10 years ago, investors saw the broadcaster as a slow-moving company catering to an older audience, compared with the young, scrappy Viacom, whose networks include Nickelodeon and MTV. But CBS shares have  outperformed those of Viacom over the last five years. Shari Redstone, Sumner Redstone's daughter and an owner of National Amusements, has favored recombining the two under the leadership of CBS Chief Executive Officer Leslie Moonves, sources have previously told Reuters. But for a deal to happen, the Redstones will have to assure Moonves he will have full autonomy over the combined company, according to a person familiar with the situation, who wished to remain anonymous because he is not permitted to speak to the media.  Reuters was first to report on Wednesday that National Amusements could contact CBS and Viacom as soon as this week to ask them to form independent board committees to discuss a potential merger. Industry speculation that the two might tie up has increased in recent weeks after the Redstones prevailed over a power struggle that resulted in the departure of Viacom Chief Executive Officer Philippe Dauman. Both companies acknowledged receipt of the letter.  CBS's management and independent directors \"will take appropriate actions to evaluate what is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders,\" a representative said. Viacom said it expected its board to form a special committee of independent directors to consider National Amusements' request. In its letter, National Amusements said the optimal deal would be an all-stock transaction giving holders of each company shares in the combined entity of the same class they currently own. Any transaction would require the approval of both boards.  Sumner and Shari Redstone will not vote on the deal as directors of Viacom and CBS or participate in deliberations, according to the letter. David Andelman, a CBS director, also will not participate in the process. It is within National Amusements' rights to refuse considering any other acquisition of either company, two lawyers familiar with the matter said on Thursday.  The NAI letter does not require the board of either company to run a wider sales process because it would be “an act of futility,” said one of the lawyers, who is an expert on Delaware law and did not want to be named.

Binding bids for Cabela's are due this week, the people said. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Cabela's, Goldman Sachs, Sycamore and Synchrony declined comment. Capital One and Bass Pro were not immediately available for comment. Cabela's shares jumped as much as 4.5 percent on the news and were trading up 2.9 percent at $53.86 in late afternoon trading in New York on Thursday, giving the company a market capitalization of $3.7 billion. Sidney, Nebraska-based Cabela's said last December that it was working with investment bank Guggenheim Securities LLC to explore strategic alternatives, including a sale, following pressure from Elliott. Cabela's was founded in 1961 by Dick Cabela and has roughly 80 stores in 36 U.S. states and nine in Canada. It also runs a large catalog business, which contributes roughly 24 percent of sales. Cabela's also owns a credit card business called World's Foremost Bank. This had nearly 2 million accounts with roughly $5 billion in loans and $502 million in revenue in 2015, according to the company's latest annual report. Springfield, Missouri-based Bass Pro Shops was founded in 1971 by Johnny Morris, who still owns most of the company. Bass Pro has roughly 100 stores across North America. Reuters reported last November that Bass Pro was exploring a bid for Cabela's. "

Investment firm Greybull Capital LLP bought the steelworks, based in Scunthorpe, northern England for 1 pound, reviving the historic British Steel brand, saving some 4,000 UK steel jobs and up to four times that amount in sectors dependent on steel making.     \"I am delighted to be able to announce that we have returned the business to profitability. We've been gaining market share and should come back to the position of being a (key) UK construction supplier, but we're not there yet,\" Executive Chairman Roland Junck told journalists at the plant on Thursday. British Steel plans to inject 50 million pounds ($65 million) of capital in the current financial year, and Junck said it would need to do this several times over in the coming years. Some 5,000 jobs have been axed in the British steel sector since last October, equal to about a fifth of the workforce, as it struggles to compete with cheap Chinese imports and some of the highest energy costs and green taxes in the world. British Steel's announcement that it has turned a profit making steel in Britain and expects to continue doing so in the year to end-March 2017 offers some hope for the sector, and for the community around Scunthorpe. \"We went through 14 months of hell, we thought we were going to shut down,\" Paul McBean of the Community union said.  \"I now bump into people who thank me for the work I've done - a shop owner who thought he was going out of business and is now in a position to open another shop.\"  The Greybull deal with Tata Steel included a 400 million pound investment and financing package and the investment firm did not take on any pension liabilities. Tata Steel, which wants to reduce its exposure to the European steel sector by merging its EU assets with Germany's Thussenkrupp, said this month its net loss widened to $477 million in the quarter to end-June due to the sale of its Scunthorpe based business to Greybull. British Steel employs 4,400 people in the UK and another 400 in France. It makes more than 2.8 million tonnes of steel a year and has a 4.5 million tonne capacity, enough for 615 Eiffel Towers.  The company is working with the British government to secure a level playing field for British steelmakers, which it says continue to face many challenges, including the uncertainty created by Britain's vote to leave the European Union. \"There are differences which handicap the UK in terms of business rates, energy prices,\" Junck said. \"What we would like to see fundamentally, is what every country has, which is a long term industrial strategy.\" "

    "text": "LONDON A $24-billion deal to build Britain's first new nuclear power station in decades was signed behind closed doors in London on Thursday in a private ceremony that underlined Prime Minister Theresa May's cautious approach to the Franco-Chinese project.  Journalists were not invited to the event but the government said the contract had been formally signed by Britain's Business Secretary Greg Clark, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault and China's National Energy Administration Director Nur Bekri. Hinkley Point C will now be built in southwest England by France's EDF (EDF.PA) with $8 billion of cash from China. \"Britain needs to upgrade its supplies of energy, and we have always been clear that nuclear power stations like Hinkley play an important part in ensuring our future low-carbon energy security,\" Clark said in a brief statement.  The no-frills event, lacking in pomp or publicity, contrasted sharply with the approach of May's predecessor David Cameron, who secured China's involvement in the project during a lavish state visit laid on for President Xi Jinping last year. The signing ceremony also followed months of uncertainty.  The French state-controlled utility EDF had to overcome a bruising boardroom battle in order to approve the deal in July, only to see Britain's new prime minister put it on hold just hours later, stunning Paris and Beijing and scuppering a planned large signing ceremony due to be held at the plant.  A former colleague said May had been concerned by the security implications of the planned Chinese investment.  Hinkley was finally given the green light earlier this month after the government included the proviso that it would be able to block the sale of EDF's controlling stake. The government also said it would take a more cautious approach in future over foreign investment in big infrastructure projects. \"OPPORTUNITY FOR FUTURE\" The EDF board confirmed its approval of the project again in a meeting on Wednesday.  \"It's a good deal,\" France's Ayrault told reporters earlier in the day. \"I know it has raised questions, particularly in France, but it represents an opportunity for the future of an entire industry.\" The deal - in the works for more than a decade and the first in a series of new nuclear projects in Britain - is part of a recovery of the global nuclear power industry following a slump caused by the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. The first of the two new reactors at Hinkley Point is scheduled to be running by the middle of the next decade. Hinkley Point will provide around 7 percent of Britain's electricity, helping to fill a supply gap as the country's coal plants are set to close by 2025. Critics have said the project is too expensive and does not reflect falling energy prices since the deal was drawn up, or anticipated declines in the costs of rival clean technologies like wind and solar power. At 92.5 pounds per megawatt hour, Britain has agreed to pay  roughly double the current market price for electricity for 35 years. \"It's no wonder the UK government has opted for a 'champagne-free' signing ceremony away from public view,\" Greenpeace UK executive director John Sauven said.  According to documents released by the department of business, 64 percent of materials and services used on the plant will be British, while EDF said it would not call on a 2 billion pound loan offered by the British government.  EDF said the project was of strategic importance to the French firm and the nuclear industry in general.  \"Hinkley Point C will kickstart Britain's nuclear revival,\" EDF Energy CEO Vincent de Rivaz said. \"It has overcome obstacles and challenges which will benefit our next nuclear projects in Britain.\" China also plans to make a number of investments in British nuclear power, including the building and operating of a new station with EDF at Bradwell-on-Sea, southeast England. Bradwell would be a Chinese-led project, using Chinese reactor technology.  "

    "text": "U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management has been pushing Avianca Holdings SA AVT_p.CN (AVH.N), one of Latin America's largest airlines, into a sale or strategic partnership, though it does not hold a stake in the carrier, the Financial Times reported. Elliott has held talks with the company's senior executives in recent weeks and has provided input on Avianca's line of action in future, FT reported,  citing people close to the company. (on.ft.com/2cYMYxT) The hedge fund provided loans to Bolivian-born entrepreneur Germán Efromovich, the carrier's controlling shareholder, more than a year ago, against the value of Efromovich's 51 per cent stake in the company, the report said. Efromovich had taken the loans to invest in shipyards in Brazil with his Synergy Group conglomerate, which provides oil exploration services and operates domestic airlines. However, the investment fell into financial difficulty, and Elliott stands to gain if the airline is sold, the FT report said. Avianca said in June that it was not looking at a sale, but had indulged in talks with other airlines to look for possible partnerships that will speed up growth. Latin American airlines have been hit by economic woes and a slump in the value of currencies in the region, and have shifted flights away from countries such as Brazil and Venezuela to growing economies such as Peru. Reuters had reported that United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N), Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) and China's HNA Group have shown interest in purchasing Avianca, which is a key player in South and Central America. Elliott and Avianca were not immediately available for comment. Avianca's U.S.-listed shares were up 1.5 percent at $6.50 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Up to Wednesday's close, the stock had risen about 50 percent this year. "

    "text": "TORONTO Canada's Kirkland Lake Gold (KLG.TO) will acquire Australian miner Newmarket Gold (NMI.TO) for about C$1 billion ($764 million) in stock, creating a mid-tier producer poised to grow, the companies said on Thursday. The transaction is somewhat of an outlier, as gold mining executives say the rising price of bullion has made acquisitions costlier for a sector focused on financial discipline. The combination makes \"something we can build from,\" Kirkland Lake Chief Executive Officer Tony Makuch said on a conference call. Kirkland Lake will hold 57 percent of the new company, which will have the same name, and Newmarket shareholders will get 43 percent. Shares of Kirkland Lake fell 6.5 percent to C$10.39 on the Toronto Stock Exchange after the deal was announced, while Newmarket gained 0.8 percent to C$4.87. The transaction comes just 10 months after Kirkland Lake acquired fellow Canadian gold miner St Andrew Goldfields for about C$178 million in stock, creating an Ontario-focused producer with four mines and two mills. The new Kirkland Lake will operate seven underground mines and five mills, producing more than 500,000 ounces of gold in 2016.  Output will be anchored by Kirkland Lake's Macassa and Taylor mines in Ontario and Newmarket's Fosterville mine in Victoria, Australia. Exploration around existing sites is expected to drive production growth, said Makuch. Management said the combined company, with a market capitalization of about C$2.4 billion, would get increased analyst coverage and valuation. \"We see significant upside here on valuation,\" Newmarket CEO Doug Forster said on the conference call. \"That's really one of the motivations for us.\" Newmarket shareholders will receive 0.475 shares of the combined company for each share held. The companies said the deal valued Newmarket at C$5.28 per share, a 9.4 percent premium to its close on Wednesday. Shareholders of both companies must approve the deal, which the parties expect to close in the fourth quarter. Luxor Capital Group, which holds about 15.7 million Newmarket shares, said in a release that it supported the deal.  Foster said the deal also had the support of Canadian fund manager Eric Sprott, Kirkland Lake's non-executive chairman with stakes of about 6.7 percent in that company and 15 percent in Newmarket Gold. Sprott will be chairman of the combined company. "

An outright sale of Save-A-Lot would deprive Supervalu of  one its fastest-growing businesses, but also allow it to focus on improving profit margins in its wholesale distribution food business, which has suffered from deflationary price pressures, lower traffic and customer attrition. Supervalu is considering a sale of Save-A-Lot to Onex as an alternative to a spinoff and is expected to make a final decision on the future of that business in the next two weeks, the people said on Thursday. The price that Onex is offering could not be learned, but sources have previously indicated that Save-A-Lot could be valued at as much as $1.8 billion. The sources requested anonymity because the deliberations are confidential. Supervalu and Onex did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Shares of Supervalu were up 8.7 percent at $4.95 in late morning trading in New York on Thursday, giving the company a market capitalization of $1.3 billion. Supervalu, based in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, announced its intention to spin off Save-A-Lot a year ago. Reuters reported in December that Supervalu would consider an outright sale of Save-A-Lot after receiving interest from private equity firms. The buyout firms that made offers for Save-A-Lot were hoping to take advantage of a so-called tax shield resulting from a loss in Supervalu's $3.3 billion sale of supermarket retailer Albertsons Companies Inc and other stores to buyout firm Cerberus Capital Management LP in 2013, sources have said previously. Save-A-Lot operated 472 stores as of June 18, with 896 additional stores operated by its licensees, mostly in the Southern and Eastern United States, according to the latest regulatory filing on its planned spin-off. Supervalu has undergone significant management changes since announcing its intent to spin off Save-A-Lot, with Eric Claus, formerly chief executive officer of supermarket company Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, joining as CEO of Save-a-Lot, and Mark Gross, previously a co-president of grocery distributor C&S Wholesale Grocery, joining as CEO of Supervalu.

The potential sale of Morpho to Advent would value the business at 2.425 billion euros ($2.7 billion) and result in a pre-tax capital gain, partially state-owned Safran said in a statement. Advent was on a shortlist of bidders reported to include digital security firm Gemalto and three funds: Bain Capital, CVC Capital Partners and KKR. With technology and jobs in France at stake, the outcome of the contest was politically sensitive, especially given the backdrop of a row over the planned closure of a plant operated by Alstom, another partially state-owned French champion. Safran said the business it is selling had revenue of 1.6 billion euros in 2015 and employs 7,800 people. Advent plans to merge the biometric identification business with Oberthur, which it bought in 2011, to create a group headquartered in France with 2.8 billion euros in revenue. Leading research and development and production capacities will also stay in France, said Safran, which was advised by Lazard along with Athena Capital Partners and Societe Generale. French state bank Bpifrance will take a stake in the identification business and join the board. For Safran, the deal completes its refocusing on core aerospace activities after it agreed earlier this year to sell Morpho Detection, which makes explosives detection equipment, to British engineering firm Smiths Group.

    "text": "BERLIN Shares in Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) fell to a four-year low on Thursday on concerns its plans to boost its low-cost Eurowings brand by leasing Air Berlin (AB1.DE) planes would neither lower costs nor head off larger rivals. Lufthansa has said it wants to turn Eurowings into Europe's third low-cost airline behind Ryanair (RYA.I) and easyJet (EZJ.L). The wet lease announced on Wednesday along with Lufthansa's decision to buy the rest of Brussels Airlines will provide planes for that expansion. Analysts said, however, that a deal to lease Air Berlin planes and crews for short-haul routes next summer seemed to be more of a defensive move to stop Ryanair and easyJet gaining a foothold in Germany at the expense of Air Berlin, which has been losing money for years. \"It's far from clear that this expansion will help Lufthansa to secure greater profitability,\" independent aviation consultant John Strickland said, adding Lufthansa would still feel pressure from Ryanair.  Lufthansa shares were down 2.99 percent at 9.75 euros 1229 GMT, having touched 9.725, its lowest level since September 2012.      Shares in other European airlines also slipped on Thursday after OPEC agreed to curb crude oil output in a move that could mean higher fuel costs for carriers. Ryanair said it could grow more quickly because retrenching by Air Berlin would result in fewer flight choices from Germany.  \"The German airports will then be trying to encourage Ryanair to open more routes. So I think it's likely to speed up our growth in Germany,\" Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said at an event in Copenhagen.   Michael Gierse, fund manager at Lufthansa shareholder Union Investment, said the lease deal would put Eurowings in key markets to help block easyJet and other rivals. \"But it will only delay them and not prevent them completely,\" he said.  The so-called wet lease deal for 40 planes and crew throws a financial lifeline to Air Berlin, which said it expected payments over the six-year deal to exceed 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion). Shares in the loss-making airline, which is 29 percent owned by Gulf carrier Etihad Airways, were worth almost 20 euros apiece back in 2007 but now trade for less than one euro each.  Lufthansa board member Karl Ulrich Garnadt, in charge of the Eurowings division, declined to confirm the 1.2 billion euro figure cited by Air Berlin, saying that final terms still needed to be agreed.  RBC analyst Damian Brewer said he was \"perplexed\" by the wet lease deal, noting Lufthansa could instead lease planes on the open market and crew them with new staff at market rates. Garnadt said the wet lease deal offered a quicker opportunity to grow. Lufthansa would ensure the terms fitted its requirements for Eurowings, where it aims for a cost base similar to that of easyJet, he said.  "

Oliver Schumy told a shareholder meeting that for big investors the question of which company takes over the other one did not matter.  \"What counts is the result and whether it will be possible to become one of the 10 (or) 12 big property firms (in Europe),\" Schumy said. In April, the two companies announced a new effort to merge to form a central and eastern Europe-focused powerhouse with a portfolio of around 6 billion euros ($6.73 billion) after previous attempts failed. The main condition for progress on the merger is that Immofinanz must get rid of its Russia portfolio, consisting of five Moscow shopping centers. Schumy said a decision on whether to sell the portfolio or spin it off will take a few months - less specific than a previous self-imposed deadline of the end of the year. Several representatives of small investors in Immofinanz said they would prefer a spin-off of the Moscow shopping centers rather than a quick sale so they might benefit from any revival in Russia, where Immofinanz has been forced to offer rent reductions to its tenants.

Takata faces huge costs related to the global recall of millions of potentially faulty air bag inflators, and is seeking an outside investor to increase its capital. The company received proposals from five bidders last week. The bidders include Japanese inflator maker Daicel Corp (4202.T) in partnership with U.S. buyout firm Bain Capital; U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co LP (KKR.N); U.S. air bag maker Key Safety Systems, which is likely to team up with U.S. private equity firm Carlyle Group LP (CG.O); Swedish auto safety group Autoliv Inc (ALV.N); and U.S. autoparts maker Flex-N-Gate Corp, the people said. Takata's creditors include Honda Motor Co Ltd (7267.T) and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) in Japan, as well as foreign automakers such as General Motors Co (GM.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI). Filing for bankruptcy protection is Takata's only option to retain the bidders' interest because a filing will reveal the extent of its liabilities, one of the people said. Representatives from Takata, Daicel, KKR, Carlyle and Autoliv declined to comment. Representatives at Bain Capital and Flex-N-Gate could not be immediately reached for comment. Takata faces about 1 trillion yen ($10 billion) in recall costs, according to market estimates. There is also the prospect of legal liabilities related to the inflators, which can explode with too much force, and which have been linked to at least 15 deaths, mainly in the United States. \"It is understandable that any potential sponsors want to reset Takata's 1 trillion yen in debt through bankruptcy but it is hard to accept that,\" said a senior official at a Japanese automaker. Takata's steering committee this week has been briefing officials from Japanese and foreign automakers on the five bidders' proposals, the people said. A senior official from a different Japanese automaker said both Japanese and foreign automakers would oppose Takata filing for bankruptcy protection. Takata, which has retained investment bank Lazard Ltd (LAZ.N) as advisor, had 109 billion yen in capital as at the end of June. Its debt would exceed capital if it had to cover most or all of the recall costs. So far, its automaker clients have covered the costs. ($1 = 101.5000 yen) "

    "text": "MUMBAI/HONG KONG Wal-Mart Stores Inc is in talks to buy a minority stake in India's largest e-commerce firm Flipkart, two people familiar with the matter said, as the world's biggest retailer aims to break into a fast growing but highly competitive online retail market. One of the sources said the U.S. retailer was looking to invest between $750 million and $1 billion in Flipkart, but the final value and size of the stake would depend on the outcome of talks about the Indian company's overall valuation. A deal would pit Wal-Mart against U.S. rival Amazon.com Inc, which has been expanding rapidly in a market that Bank of America Merrill Lynch has forecast will surge to $220 billion in value of goods sold by 2025 from about $11 billion last year.  Wal-Mart operates 21 wholesale stores in the South Asian country, but is discouraged from setting up its own bricks-and-mortar shops by rules that limit foreign ownership for multi-brand retailers to 51 percent and the cost of setting up shops in a country as large as India. For Flipkart, a cash infusion from Wal-Mart would come in handy at a time when funding from traditional investors into the online space such as venture capital is proving harder to obtain amid worries about valuations in India. Kashyap Chanchani, managing partner of the Rainmaker Group, a Mumbai-based tech and digital media investment banking firm, said it was natural for Wal-Mart to want to partner with Flipkart. \"India does not lend itself to big box retail since rentals are very very expensive,\" he said.  If a deal is agreed, Wal-Mart would join other foreign strategic investors in India's online players. China's Alibaba Group Holding, Japan's SoftBank Group Corp and Taiwan's Foxconn last year led an investment of $500 million in Flipkart's smaller rival Snapdeal. Alibaba is also the biggest shareholder in India's One97 Communications, which operates payments services and an e-commerce market place under the PayTM trade name. The sources declined to be identified because the talks are preliminary and have not been made public. Wal-Mart in India and Flipkart declined to comment. CUT-THROAT COMPETITION Launched in 2007 by two former Amazon employees, Flipkart sells everything from cellphones to suitcases and cosmetics. Its current investors include Tiger Global Management and Accel Partners. A Wal-Mart bet on Flipkart would come at a time when Amazon is planning an aggressive expansion into India.  Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of the online retailer, said in June it would invest an additional $3 billion in India after investing $2 billion already, and has recently rolled out its Prime membership service in the country. Bank of America estimated Amazon could increase its market share to 37 percent by 2019 from 31 percent now, approaching the 44 percent held currently by Flipkart. But concerns about profits continue to weigh on the sector, as severe competition is forcing the online retailers to resort to heavy discounts while they also need to invest in infrastructure such as warehouse centers. Indian brokerage Kotak estimated Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal lost a combined 50 billion rupees  ($751.46 million) in the year ended in March 2015.  The online retailers do not disclose financial data but analysts say losses likely have increased since then.  Flipkart has been valued at about $11.5 billion, local media reported last month, citing a U.S. regulatory filing from investor Valic, a division of American International Group Inc, down from as much as $15 billion earlier this year.  Wal-Mart agreed in June to take a 5 percent stake in China's JD.com Inc, giving the U.S. firm a ringside seat in JD.com's bitter rivalry with Alibaba Group.  ($1 = 66.5375 Indian rupees) "

China's government is keen to lure private capital to infrastructure projects to alleviate the debt burden of local authorities, and has promised policies to support PPPs. In January, the state planner said it would test PPPs in the railway sector with eight high-speed and intercity rail projects including one in Zhejiang province linking the coastal cities of Hangzhou and Wenzhou. Fosun in an e-mailed statement said wholly owned subsidiary Shanghai Fosun High Technology Group Co Ltd [FOSUIA.UL] signed an agreement with the Zhejiang government for that project's first phase joining the cities of Hangzhou and Taizhou. Fosun did not state how much it would invest in the project. Its chairman, billionaire Guo Guangcheng, in the statement said there was much scope for investment as infrastructure per capita in China lagged that of developed countries. China built the world's longest high-speed rail network in less than a decade but its national railway operator took on heavy debt in the process. At the end of June, China Railway Corp's liabilities totaled 4.21 trillion yuan. Fosun also said Sunvision Capital, a subsidiary of its property arm, was involved in close to 500 billion yuan worth of PPP projects across China. ($1 = 6.6730 Chinese yuan renminbi) "

    "text": "LONDON At least four private equity funds including BC Partners are in talks to buy a majority stake in Italy's fourth-biggest supermarket chain Esselunga in a deal worth up to 6 billion euros ($6.7 billion), sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The talks, led by Citi, started earlier this year amid efforts to find a succession plan for the business, which runs more than 150 stores across Italy and is held by Bernardo Caprotti, who will turn 91 on Oct. 7. London-based BC Partners is one of two private equity houses which recently joined the race to submit offers and outbid previous expressions of interest from two other heavyweight funds, Blackstone (BX.N) and CVC Capital Partners [CVC.UL], the sources said.  Esselunga, Blackstone and BC Partners declined to comment while CVC was not immediately available for comment. Caprotti, who co-founded the business in 1957, started informal talks with Blackstone and CVC about six months ago, the sources said. The two funds were later granted access to the company's books in August to perform due diligence, one of the sources said, but price disagreements soon emerged. After extensive negotiations with Blackstone and CVC, Caprotti asked Citi to launch a strategic review to sound out interest from other buyout funds, they said.     Italian private equity group Investindustrial was informally asked to take part in the negotiations for Esselunga but has yet to decide whether to make an offer, another source said. The size of the transaction may be challenging for some private equity firms, this source said, and these funds could try to team up in a consortium with Italian investors. Blackstone and CVC have almost completed their due diligence work and remain keen to win control, the sources said. Caprotti is against a sale of Esselunga to any of its direct competitors, the sources said, and doesn't want to entertain talks with industry rivals. The billionaire businessman, who has been in a long-running legal dispute with the two children of his first marriage over ownership of the chain, stepped down as Esselunga chairman in 2011 and resigned from all executive functions in 2013. But he has a final say on any change of ownership and his price expectations are seen as ambitious, the sources said, cautioning that the talks may yet fall apart. Based in Milan, Esselunga holds a portfolio of real estate assets worth more than 1 billion euros, one of the sources said, adding the deal's value will hinge on whether these assets will be part of it. Caprotti, who comes from a long line of Italian businessmen and often airs his views in the media, has rebuffed overtures from international supermarket chains in recent years, another source said. ROLL OUT Esselunga, which employs nearly 22,000 people in seven Italian regions, primarily in the North of the country, grew its revenues by 4.3 percent last year to an overall 7.3 billion euros with core earnings of 625 million euros. It offers private equity suitors the opportunity to roll out the Milan-based business across Southern Italy and win market share from Coop, Conad and Selex, which rank as Italy's largest supermarkets by market share, the sources said. A number of buyout funds have recently expressed interest in European supermarket chains including Polish convenience chain Zabka Polska. Earlier this year CVC teamed up with Qatar's QIA and Canada's Brookfield Asset Management to bid for British supermarket group Sainsbury (SBRY.L). BC Partners bought 50.8 percent of Turkey's largest supermarket chain Migros in 2008 and subsequently sold part of its stake to Turkish beverage firm Anadolu Endustri Holding last year.

    "text": "Sumner Redstone's National Amusements Inc is preparing to call on CBS Corp (CBS.N) and Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) to explore a merger, two people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. National Amusements is the controlling shareholder of both media companies, which separated from each other 10 years ago. A merger would give Viacom, whose networks include Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and MTV, a seasoned media executive at the helm in CBS CEO Leslie Moonves at a time when its TV ratings and ad revenue are in decline, many investors believe. The possible benefits for CBS are less clear, beyond the company gaining scale, which could help with negotiations with cable and satellite distributors. CBS's ratings and ad revenue have been strong over the past few years and Moonves has resisted the idea of a recombination, other people familiar with the situation have said. Investors tentatively welcomed the prospect of a deal, if only to end the uncertainty that has hovered over the companies for the past two years as the ailing 93-year-old Redstone has become less involved in their operations.  “We would like to see CBS continue on its path of success and bring Viacom along with the ride,” said Michael Cuggino,  president at San Francisco-based Permanent Portfolio Family of Funds, which owns voting shares of CBS and Viacom. He said his enthusiasm for a deal would depend on the details. A merger could save $400 million in costs between the two companies and give them greater clout in the consolidating world of television, according to Michael Nathanson, senior analyst at MoffettNathanson Research. Viacom shares jumped as much as 7 percent after Reuters exclusively reported National Amusement's plans, and ended trading up 3 percent at $36.56, giving the company a market value of $14.7 billion. CBS shares closed up 4 percent at $54.15, indicating a market value of just over $24 billion. SPECIAL COMMITTEES A combination of CBS and Viacom would be the latest example of a deal between two companies with high-profile owners in common.  Elon Musk is the largest shareholder in both Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) and SolarCity Corp (SCTY.O), which announced a deal in August. A month earlier, Larry Ellison's Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) said it would buy NetSuite Inc (N.N), 40 percent of whose shares are controlled by Ellison. In both those cases the companies formed special board committees to explore all transactions available to them before agreeing to a deal.  National Amusements may contact CBS and Viacom as early as this week to ask them to form such independent board committees, one of the sources said. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Representatives for National Amusements, Viacom and CBS declined to comment. National Amusements, the privately held movie theater company owned by Redstone and his daughter Shari Redstone, own 80 percent of the voting shares of Viacom and CBS. Viacom was spun off from CBS in 2006, but Shari Redstone has been in favor of recombining the two under the leadership of Moonves, sources have previously told Reuters. Industry speculation that the two might tie up has increased over the past few weeks, after the Redstones prevailed over a power struggle that resulted in the departure of Viacom Chief Executive Officer Philippe Dauman. CBS DOUBTS, VIACOM STRUGGLES  However, Moonves has previously indicated he is not warm to the idea. \"We are never going to do something that is bad for CBS shareholders,\" he told investors at a Bank of America Merrill Lynch investor conference earlier this month, adding that the two companies were not \"in active discussions.\" Last week, Viacom, which has more than $12 billion in debt, slashed its dividend by half to 20 cents per share and said it expects a fourth-quarter adjusted profit of 65 to 70 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting 89 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Viacom, which also owns Paramount Pictures, announced last week that its interim CEO, longtime Viacom executive Tom Dooley, would be leaving in November, opening a gap at the top of the company as its board navigates the way forward. Merging Viacom back into CBS is the most logical solution, particularly for Sumner Redstone, who is known to be very attached to pieces of Viacom, particularly its Paramount studios, according to Mario Gabelli, whose firm is the second-largest owner of voting shares of both Viacom and CBS after Redstone. Gabelli would not say whether he favors a deal. \"It's always a question for my clients as to 'What do I get?,\" he said.  Despite Viacom's recent issues, there is still a lot of value in the company, he said. \"It's a fixer-upper,\" said Gabelli. \"It's like prime real estate on a beach overlooking a bluff in East Hampton, but the house sucks.\" "

    "text": "BARCELONA Airbus Group (AIR.PA) Chief Executive Tom Enders is extending a promised overhaul of Europe’s largest aerospace group by promoting two top managers to oversee crucial functions like engineering as they usher the company into the age of Big Data. The plan marks a further shake-up at the top after it emerged last week that Enders plans to make Fabrice Bregier his No. 2 by appointing him as group chief operating officer, on top of his role as head of the dominant Airbus planemaking unit. Guillaume Faury, who leads Airbus Helicopters, is expected to have group-wide responsibility for engineering within the company's plan to introduce more digital methods into its operations, the sources said. They asked not to be named because the plan has not been formally approved. Nine months after arriving from Germany's Siemens (SIEGn.DE), Dirk Hoke, the head of Airbus Defence & Space, the group's second largest division, would be awarded oversight of program management and new services as part of the plans to reshape the way Airbus develops, produces and supports aircraft. The proposal builds on efforts to knit together a once faction-ridden company and mark an end to what Enders described in the past as \"fiefdoms\" inside the group, whose products range from jetliners to satellites and choppers to fighter jets. Airbus Group (AIR.PA) declined comment. An announcement on the widely anticipated overhaul could come later this week. Enders said in a letter to staff last week that organizational changes would be finalised soon, adding \"lean structures\" and speedy decision-making were both priorities. Group-wide roles have historically struck a sensitive note inside the Franco-German-led firm, because they step across business lines previously identified with national priorities. It was not immediately clear exactly what role the overlapping business heads would play in each other's divisions, each of which faces pressing industrial challenges and can ill afford any loss of focus, according to analysts. But people familiar with the plans said daily control of standalone projects such as the new Airbus A350 or troubled A400M military plane would stay in their respective divisions. Insiders say it is not, in the immediate term, chiefly seen as a cost-cutting exercise but that it would prepare the ground for modernization plans relying on digital design, production and support methods that would also require some new investment. Job cuts have not been ruled out, however, particularly as a result of slow demand for A380 jetliners and civil helicopters.     Others say it strengthens Enders' grip after longstanding tensions with Bregier, who is expected to give up his title as chief executive of the Airbus commercial unit while remaining its president and cementing his status as likely next group CEO.     Enders recently named Marc Fontaine the company's first digital transformation officer. In his wider role, newly recruited Hoke is expected to bring a fresh perspective to program management, which has been a problem area for many planemakers in recent years, and develop new services beyond the traditional job of selling parts. Aircraft connectivity, for example, was identified as one of the key growth areas in new services for the jet industry at the ISTAT Europe aviation conference in Barcelona this week. "

The board is also expected to discuss plans for Lufthansa to take jets for Eurowings from Air Berlin (AB1.DE), sources have said, to help it become the third largest low-cost airline in Europe after Ryanair (RYA.I) and easyJet (EZJ.L). Lufthansa said this year it was discussing how to bring Brussels Airlines, which has 49 planes, into its Eurowings platform, which has about 90 planes now. Brussels Airlines is strong on routes to Africa, where the Lufthansa network has gaps, and the German carrier has said it will look at ways to keep some of the branding. Lufthansa bought 45 percent of Brussels Airlines owner SN Airholding in 2009 for 65 million euros ($73 million), with an option to acquire the rest from 2011. Because Lufthansa has loaned 45 million euros to Brussels Airlines, the German carrier can buy the rest for as little as 2.6 million euros more, which has irked Belgian shareholders of the holding firm, Belgian daily Le Soir has reported. A person familiar with the matter confirmed the figure of 2.6 million euros. The concept for bringing Brussels into the Lufthansa Group must now be discussed in detail, a spokesman for the German airline said following the supervisory board's decision.  Lufthansa had delayed a decision about whether to exercise its option to buy all of Brussels Airlines after fatal attacks at the airport and metro system in the Belgian capital in March.  Brussels Airlines served a record 7.5 million passengers in 2015 and made a record net profit of 41.3 million euros. Passengers numbers decreased in March and April as a result of the attacks but have been recovering since.

Liberty Steel bought the 144-year-old Dalzell plant in Motherwell and its sister works at Clydebridge in Glasgow in April from Tata Steel (TISC.NS) for a symbolic sum, with the Scottish government underpinning the process. Tata mothballed the plants at the end of 2015 due to the impact of cheap Chinese imports, causing the loss of 270 jobs and sparking fears for the area's economy after the closure of a nearby plant in Ravenscraig in 1992. Fresh from watching molten slabs of steel roll out of the furnace, Sturgeon described the revival of the steel plate mill as \"a very positive signal that the steel and engineering industries still have a future in Scotland\". \"It is a difficult market, but we now have a company in the ownership of Dalzell that has a vision of what they want to achieve,\" she told Sky News. Britain's ability to compete in the global steel market was thrown into the spotlight earlier this year when Tata Steel put its entire British operations up for sale. Several groups including Liberty have expressed an interest in those assets, which include the Port Talbot steel plant in Wales, but Tata is currently exploring options for a joint venture with Germany's Thyssenkrupp.  Gupta said on Wednesday he was now also looking to open an electric arc furnace in Scotland. \"The most compelling place to build an electric arc furnace is the Midlands (in England) because it's a big generator of scrap and a big consumer of steel,\" he told Reuters. \"But we are looking to do it in Scotland also, mainly because of the Scottish government, their enthusiasm.  \"It's been a great experience working here.\" In a nod to Gupta's Indian heritage, a steel pellet sculpture of Ganesha, Hindu god of beginnings, had been erected for the opening.  Sturgeon, who has said she may seek another independence referendum for Scotland, told a business conference in London on Tuesday that her country was consistently outperforming every part of the UK except London when it came to attracting inward investment. Steel plate is used in industries like construction, shipbuilding, automotive, mining and energy sectors.  Dalzell is also looking to make plates for the manufacture of wind turbines and in the longer term could seek to supply projects like Hinkley Point, the new nuclear plant due to be built in southwest England.   Liberty has spent five months preparing to reactivate Dalzell's furnace and rolling mill to produce 150,000 tonnes of steel plate a year.  It has hired around 120 staff, mostly former employees, and hopes to increase output to 500,000 tonnes eventually, employing 200 people within 18 months.  Gupta said the Clydebridge works would come back on stream \"in due course as market conditions allowed\". Britain currently consumes 700,000 tonnes per year of plate steel, increasing at around three percent annually.   "

    "text": "BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT EU antitrust regulators on Wednesday raised a raft of concerns over the proposed $28 billion merger between Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE) and the London Stock Exchange (LSE.L), saying it could hinder competition in key financial market activities. The European Commission said it would investigate over the next four months whether the deal would sharply reduce competition in clearing, derivatives and index licensing. Deutsche Boerse and the London Stock Exchange, which had anticipated criticism of the deal, immediately said they would explore the sale of LCH SA, the French clearing subsidiary of the LSE's LCH.Clearnet group. Their quick reaction contrasts with Deutsche Boerse's late-stage concessions in its effort five years ago to merge with the New York Stock Exchange, which the Commission vetoed. The chief executive of rival pan-European exchange Euronext (ENX.PA) has said he would look at options for Clearnet if it comes up for sale. France, Belgium, Portugal and the Netherlands - trading locations of Euronext - have expressed concerns about the combined company, which would have a huge presence in derivatives clearing. The Commission cited concerns about reduced competition in clearing where the merged company would create the largest margin pool in the world, worth 150 billion euros ($168 billion), and in derivatives. \"Financial markets provide an essential function for the European economy. We must ensure that market participants continue to have access to financial market infrastructure on competitive terms,\" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. Other areas of concern for the Commission include repo markets, German stocks, exchange traded funds (ETFs) and futures and options based on Italian shares. The EU antitrust enforcer will rule on the proposed merger by Feb. 13, a deadline which would be extended once the companies submit concessions. Industrial lobbying group European Investors Association last month warned of the dangers of a quasi-monopolistic stock market which could dictate listing fees and costs and harm competition.  "

    "text": "LONDON The London Stock Exchange Group (LSE.L) said it could hive off the French half of its LCH.Clearnet arm in a bid to ease European Union concerns about exchange's planned merger with Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE). LCH.Clearnet is already one of the world's largest clearing houses for shares and derivatives, and the EU's competition unit said on Wednesday it was concerned over what would happen to competition if it was allowed to combine with Deutsche Boerse's Eurex clearing arm. The London Stock Exchange said it wanted to \"address proactively\" the anti-trust concerns raised by the European Commission. \"LSEG confirms that LSEG and LCH Group Limited intend to explore a potential sale of LCH SA, LCH Group Limited's French-regulated operating subsidiary,\" the London exchange said in a statement. LCH.Clearnet was formed by a merger in 2003 of the London Clearing House and Clearnet of France. \"Any potential sale of LCH SA would be subject to the review and approval by the European Commission in connection with the recommended merger of LSEG and Deutsche Börse,\" the London exchange said. \"It would also be conditional on the successful closing of the merger.\" The LSE could be forced by Brussels to hive off Clearnet in any case in return for merger approval. Analysts have said that a potential buyer for Clearnet would be Euronext, the exchange group that trades French, Belgian, Dutch and Portuguese shares and has opposed the London-Frankfurt merger. French President Francois Hollande wants euro-denominated clearing, an area dominated by LCH.Clearnet in London, to shift to the euro zone, and a euro zone buyer of Clearnet could go some way to achieving that.

    "text": "DUESSELDORF, Germany Some of RWE's (RWEG.DE) cash-strapped municipal shareholders will not take part in the initial public offering of Innogy, the German utility's healthy assets that will be listed next week. Innogy, which consists of RWE's networks, renewables and retail business, will be listed on Oct. 7 in Germany's largest IPO since 2000, potentially valuing the unit at up to 20 billion euros ($22.41 billion), more than twice the market valuation of RWE. Since it was founded in 1898, RWE has been deeply rooted in Germany's Ruhr industrial heartland, relying on local support for its power and gas supply business. As a provider of jobs in the region, local municipalities, which hold about 24 percent of the company, have an interest in its survival, making a decision to sell RWE shares to buy Innogy stock difficult. \"We will not take a stake in Innogy initially,\" said a spokesman for Dortmund's local utility DSW21, where the city holds its 23.6 million shares in RWE, currently worth about 343 million euros. \"It's key for us that jobs will be preserved,\" the DSW21 spokesman added. RWE, which will still own at least 75 percent in Innogy following the listing, is keeping struggling coal- and gas-fired power generation assets and volatile energy trading operations. Municipalities are also heavily indebted and could struggle to take part in the offering of shares worth up to 5 billion euros, having been dealt a blow earlier this year when RWE suspended its dividend for the first time in at least six decades. The Dortmund spokesman did not rule out that DSW21, which holds 4.1 percent of RWE, could take a stake in Innogy at a later date by selling existing RWE stock. Shareholder Essen, where Germany's second-largest utility is based, also has no plans to buy shares in Innogy, a spokeswoman for the city said, adding she could not rule out a purchase of Innogy shares or a sale of RWE stock in the future. Essen holds more than 3 percent in RWE. Other local shareholders, including the city of Bochum, are considering sharply reducing their holdings in RWE, as they no longer can rely on a stable payout in their budgets. Bochum, which also has no plans to buy Innogy shares, could sell a third of its 6.6 million RWE shares at a price of more than 15 euros, its treasurer Manfred Busch said. They currently trade at 14.65 euros. "

    "text": "LONDON/BRUSSELS SABMiller SAB.L shareholders overwhelmingly backed the brewer's $100 billion-plus takeover by Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR) on Wednesday, clearing the last big hurdle for one of the largest corporate mergers in history.  The combined group will sell more than a quarter of all beers sold worldwide and be the fifth largest consumer goods company. For the maker of Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois it provides entry into Africa and large fast-growing Latin American markets such as Colombia and Peru.  It will also cut its revenue from mature markets North America and Europe to 37 from 47 percent. AB InBev's 79 billion pound  ($102.85 billion) bid passed in a meeting at a London Park Lane hotel lasting less than half an hour, overseen by Chairman Jan du Plessis, who fielded only two questions from shareholders.  It secured support representing 95.5 percent of SABMiller share value, having needed at least 75 percent to succeed. In an earlier meeting in Brussels, AB InBev Chief Executive Carlos Brito said the new entity would continue to be called Anheuser-Busch InBev, eschewing any corporate reference to SABMiller, founded 120 years ago in South Africa. The brewer had changed its name after transformative deals in the past, such as InBev's 2008 takeover of Anheuser-Busch.  \"They can call it what they wish. That's the way life works and that's fine,\" du Plessis told reporters after the meeting. \"It's what it is.\"  He added that AB InBev were paying \"a full price\".     NOT A GIVEN  The approval of SAB shareholders was widely expected, but not a given. Criticism of the takeover offer grew after a steep fall in sterling following Britain's vote to leave the European Union made AB InBev's cash offer less appealing.  Activist shareholders pressured SAB to seek a higher offer, prompting AB InBev to sweeten its bid in July. SAB backed the higher offer, and its two largest shareholders, cigarette maker Altria Group (MO.N) and the Santo Domingo family of Colombia, who together control about 40 percent of the shares, gave their support and did not vote on Wednesday. However, some prominent shareholders, including Aberdeen Asset Management, continued to oppose it. \"We are obviously disappointed with, but not surprised by, the result,\" Aberdeen said in a statement, adding it felt the final price still \"significantly undervalued\" SABMiller.  Despite hedge funds piling into the stock over the summer in the hope of a higher offer, Thomson Reuters data showed just six hedge funds with a collective investment of $211 million remained shareholders as the deal crossed the line.  The lion's share of that, $199 million, was held by New York-based Soroban Capital, with smaller positions held by HBK Investments, Platinum Capital Management, Elliott Management, Farallon Capital Management and Davidson Kempner Capital. Cost-conscious AB InBev expects to extract at least $1.4 billion in annual cost savings after four years, it said, in addition to the $1.05 billion already announced by SABMiller. Given the company's history of easily beating such targets, broker Jefferies sees it achieving $3 billion in savings. The new company will sell off joint venture stakes in the United States and China, to satisfy antitrust regulators, divest Peroni and Grolsch and kick off a sale process for SAB's central and eastern European brands, estimated to be worth up to 7 billion euros. Still, competition in individual markets will not change radically as the two companies have little geographic overlap. "

    "text": "FRANKFURT Private equity investor Bridgepoint is stepping up preparations to list France's second-largest independent private hospital group Medipole on the stock exchange by the end of the year, in a deal potentially valuing the company at about 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion), people close to the matter said.  The investor, which is working with Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) on the initial public offering, has invited analysts to listen to Medipole presentations in the second week of October, one of the people said.  The company is likely to announce its intention to float on Euronext by late October with a view to listing less than 50 percent of the shares four weeks later, the people said. Bridgepoint, Medipole and the banks declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment. Bridgepoint is hoping to benefit from buoyant equities markets, which have been on the rise due to central banks' low interest rates and a lack of investment alternatives. Medipole posted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 70 million euros on revenues of 460 million euros in the first half of 2016.  A valuation of 1.5 billion euros would be roughly in line with the EBITDA multiple that German healthcare group Fresenius (FREG.DE) agreed to pay this month in its 5.8 billion euros deal for Spain's biggest private hospital chain, Quironsalud. Quironsalud has 43 hospitals across Spain and expects to make sales of about 2.5 billion euros and EBITDA of 460-480 million euros this year.   Medipole operates 62 facilities with about 2,500 practitioners and 9,000 healthcare personnel, who treated approximately 1.1 million patients in 2015, mainly in the regions of Occitanie, Nouvelle Aquitaine, Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur and Hauts de France. Medipole, in which Bridgepoint has been invested since 2011, merged with peer Medi-Partenaires in 2014. As part of a portfolio rejig, the group acquired a clinic in Agen last month, while divesting clinics in the Paris area. In August, Bpifrance took a stake in Medipole with a 95 million euro investment in the group.  France is the second-largest healthcare market in Europe after Germany, with total annual expenditure growing at an annual average of 4 percent, hitting 246 billion euros, or 12 percent of the country's gross domestic product, in 2014.

    "text": "LONDON Novozymes (NZYMb.CO), already grappling with the consequences of low oil and crop prices, is watching anxiously to see what Bayer's (BAYGn.DE) purchase of Monsanto (MON.N) will mean for the Danish group's ties with its key agricultural partner. Chief Executive Peder Holk Nielsen said in an interview that a merged Bayer-Monsanto could extend the market for the company's smart microbial crop-boosting products, known as inoculants, but added the union also brings uncertainties. \"Of course, in the short-term we can all worry about the distraction that a $66 billion acquisition can bring and it is one of the things we have in our risk matrix,\" he told Reuters on a visit to London. \"But we think the results we have created together with Monsanto are quite significant and if the deal is concluded I think it would make a lot of sense to bring that into the new company.\" Nielsen has not yet held any discussions with Bayer about the future of its strategic tie-up with Monsanto, the BioAg Alliance, but said he expected to do so before the takeover is completed. Novozymes is relying on the alliance, which covers the sale of inoculants, to drive growth and restore sales. The agreed purchase of U.S. seeds company Monsanto by Germany's Bayer is the signature deal in a wave of agribusiness takeovers in recent years. Monsanto shares are still trading well below Bayer's offer price, however, reflecting worries that the merger could stall on antitrust issues. The takeover comes at a challenging time for Novozymes, which was spun off from drugmaker Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO) in 2000. Nielsen disappointed investors last month by lowering the forecast for sales growth this year to only 2-4 percent and warning it would take time to return to more typical growth levels of 6-7 percent. Novozymes had been doing well until recently by selling enzymes that replace chemicals in detergents and also help in the production of bioethanol and animal feed. But it has been hit by a fall in oil prices, which has slowed the development of so-called advanced biofuels made from non-edible biomass. Weak agricultural commodity prices have also reduced the incentive for farmers to invest in its inoculants. The U.S. Department of Agriculture predicted last month that farm incomes could reach their lowest point this year since 2009, hit by low corn and soy prices. \"Farmers in the U.S. are clearly being careful with their discretionary spending,\" Nielsen said. The BioAg Alliance currently has around 65 million acres sown with seed using its products, mainly soybeans, but it is hoping to increase that to between 250 million and 500 million acres with the rollout of a corn inoculant in time for the 2017 season. Analysts such as those at Berenberg Bank, which this week initiated coverage of Novozymes with a \"sell\" rating, fear that a weak agricultural economy will weigh on adoption of inoculants and hit selling prices, adding to the company's hard times.

    "text": "STOCKHOLM ZF Friedrichshafen ZFF.UL will walk away from its bid for Swedish braking systems firm Haldex (HLDX.ST) if it fails to get a 50 percent stake at its current offer of 120 crowns per share, the German car parts maker said on Wednesday. \"Below 50, we are out,\" ZF Chief Executive Stefan Sommer told reporters in Stockholm. \"We will not continue in a long-lasting bidding process which in the end is bad for the market, bad for the customer, and bad for the people of Haldex.\" A number of German car parts makers have looked at buying Haldex in recent months, in particular to get their hands on its expertise in brakes for trailers for use in integrated autonomous driving systems that are being developed for trucks. Haldex has recommended its shareholders accept ZF's bid even though it is lower than a 125 crown per share offer from German rival Knorr-Bremse STELLG.UL, citing possible antitrust concerns with the latter. ZF, which has already received all the necessary antitrust clearances to buy Haldex, holds a 21.4 percent stake in the Swedish firm, virtually unchanged from when it was last reported despite attempts to persuade more shareholders to sell. \"We couldn't gain anymore because their expectation is at a higher price level,\" Sommer said.  Haldex shares, which have consistently traded above Knorr-Bremse's 125 crown bid since the offer was made on Sept. 16, were 3.6 percent lower at 121.50 crowns at 1112 GMT. ZF's offer period ends on Oct. 3 and the firm said it would not be extended unless all conditions, including the 50 percent acceptance level, were met. Knorr-Bremse now owns 14.9 percent of the Swedish firm, according to a statement last Friday. "

    "text": "HONG KONG Postal Savings Bank of China (PSBC) (1658.HK) made a flat debut in Hong Kong as concern over the health of China's banking sector cast a shadow over the sprawling lender's $7.4 billion initial public offering, the world's biggest in two years. Even though the offer was priced near the lower end of an indicative range, PSBC shares closed just a fraction above the HK$4.76 IPO price on Wednesday at HK$4.77. The benchmark Hang Seng index .HSI ended 0.2 percent higher. The lukewarm start for the last of China's big banks to go public comes as investors keep a weather eye on bad debt piling up at Chinese banks. Retail demand for the IPO - a key metric for success in Hong Kong - was modest, with fund managers saying the deal carried a higher valuation than PSBC's peers and three-quarters of shares pre-sold to \"cornerstone\" investors, mainly other Chinese state-owned firms. [nL3N1BB30W] \"The average valuation of banking stocks is relatively low nowadays due to concerns over China's economic slowdown and mounting bad debts,\" said Danny Bao, Chief Investment Officer at HJY Capital Advisors (HK) Ltd.  \"Many Chinese banks are trading at discounts to their book,\" said Bao. \"Why would international investors buy the shares of this IPO?\"   The deal's timing also counted against it, some fund managers said: some investors are keeping their powder dry for what bankers estimate will be nearly $7 billion of IPOs likely to hit the market before November, when economic uncertainties triggered by the U.S. presidential election bring a lull.  The PSBC listing marks the end of a wave that started more than a decade ago, with IPOs by China Construction Bank Corp (CCB) (601939.SS) (0939.HK) and Bank of Communications Co Ltd (BoCom) (601328.SS) (3328.HK).  With a market capitalization of about $50 billion, PSBC ranks far behind China's \"Big Four\" banks, but outstrips international peers like Dutch lender ING Groep (INGA.AS) and Japan's Mizuho Financial Group Inc (8411.T). At a listing ceremony in Hong Kong, the chairman of PSBC said the Beijing-headquartered lender will continue to position itself as a large Chinese retail bank, serving the country's small and medium enterprises as well as rural and low-income customers.  The listing will \"force the bank to improve corporate governance and measure itself by international standards,\" said PSBC Chairman Li Guohua. The bank plans to use the proceeds to bolster its balance sheet to \"support the ongoing growth of its business\", according to its prospectus.  LOW RETAIL INTEREST PSBC's deal was the world's biggest IPO since Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's (BABA.N) $25 billion New York listing in 2014, and fee-hungry investment banks had counted on the deal to boost revenue amid a slump in new listings in the Asia-Pacific region. The 26 banks handling PSBC's offering stand to jointly earn up to $118.4 million in fees, according to the PSBC prospectus. The portion of the offer set aside for retail investors was oversubscribed just 2.6 times, PSBC said in a filing on Tuesday, a comparatively low number. The institutional tranche was well oversubscribed, the bank said. The lender had counted on its extensive network of more than 40,000 branches across China and a low level of non-performing loans to attract investors.  But many fund managers saw the deal as too pricey: PSBC's marketing range valued the bank at a price-to-book ratio for 2016 of 0.94 to 1.02 times, far higher than the average of 0.76 for Hong Kong-listed lenders. [nL3N1BW28L] At a news conference during the listing ceremony, Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd's (HKEx) (0388.HK) Chief Executive Charles Li downplayed concerns that the dominance of Chinese players among cornerstone investors might undermine the city's capital markets.  \"Cornerstone investors used to be dominated by foreign companies and now are mainly Chinese. But that's decided by the market itself,\" said Li. "

    "text": "FRANKFURT Deutsche Post DHL (DPWGn.DE) is buying independent British postal operator UK Mail Group (UKM.L) for 243 million pounds ($316 million) to cement its foothold in Europe's three largest e-commerce markets, Britain, Germany and France. European postal firms are having to cut their costs and invest in new technology and services as they try to stay ahead of new entrants in the lucrative parcel delivery market such as U.S. online retailer Amazon.com (AMZN.O). The cash offer from Deutsche Post, the world's biggest mail and logistics group, was recommended by UK Mail's directors, the two companies said on Wednesday. Deutsche Post said the 440 pence per share bid represented a 43 percent premium to UK Mail's three-month weighted average share price, and it had undertakings from shareholders holding about 60 percent of the company to accept the offer.  UK Mail shares jumped 43 percent to 440.25 pence, while Deutsche Post's rose 1.2 percent to 27.94 euros, broadly in line with the German blue-chip DAX .GDAXI. \"The on-going expansion of our parcel network in Europe is driven by increasing demand within our e-commerce customer base for cross-border deliveries,\" Deutsche Post board member Juergen Gerdes said in a statement. UK Mail, which is focused on business customers, last year launched a new hub in Coventry with machinery it said enabled it to handle 24,000 parcels an hour - four times as many as before. The market has seen a wave of consolidation in recent years. Among other, U.S.-based FedEx (FDX.N) agreed to buy Dutch TNT Express TNTE.AS last year for 4.4 billion euros, catapulting it to second place in Europe ahead of UPS (UPS.N). Deutsche Post's bid takes advantage of a slump in UK Mail's share price, which has fallen by a third over the last two years. \"The board believes that UK Mail... will be better positioned to continue to develop our parcels and mail businesses with the benefit of Deutsche Post DHL's greater financial and operational resources,\" UK Mail Chairman Peter Kane said in a statement.  Deutsche Bank advised Deutsche Post and UK Mail was advised by Investec. "

    "text": "HONG KONG Private equity firm Permira has emerged as the preferred bidder to buy Bank of East Asia Ltd's (0023.HK) share registry unit Tricor Holdings for between $750 million and $800 million, sources said on Tuesday, after six months of bidding that attracted the interest of top Chinese insurers among others. No deal has been signed yet but Permira and Bank of East Asia are in advanced talks to reach an agreement, people familiar with the matter said. Wide interest in the auction and Permira's robust bid reflect the scarcity of sizeable deals for private equity firms, which are sitting on an estimated $100 billion of undeployed cash in Asia. Bank of East Asia, run by the founding Li family, is under pressure from investor Elliott Management which has been agitating for the sale of the bank, and the lender is hoping the sale of Tricor will help win the support of shareholders in its battle with the U.S. hedge fund. Permira, which manages 31 billion euros ($34.8 billion) of investments globally, emerged as the dark horse in the auction in which Vistra Group, a business owned by Baring Asia Private Equity, was seen as the front runner. Tricor provides corporate services and is attractive to private equity firms due to its stable and steady cash generation. Permira's bid would value Tricor at about 15 times its core earnings, which totaled about $55 million last year, Reuters previously reported. Permira is expected to fund the deal with about $450 million in equity funds and the rest from borrowed money, the people said. HSBA (HSBA.L) and Japan's SMBC are among the banks providing debt financing, the people added. But some people with direct knowledge of the bidding process were surprised by Permira's aggressive offer for the business. \"It's a punchy bid especially when you consider Permira doesn't have any similar business in its portfolio, which means there is little synergies to extract,\" one of the sources said. Bank of East Asia and Permira declined to comment. Bank of East Asia has secured about five final bids, including offers from Vistra Group, Ping An Insurance Group of China (601318.SS) and Permira among others. Elliott, which owns 7 percent of Bank of East Asia, started legal proceedings against the bank in July over a share issue.  Shares in the bank have jumped 12 percent this year, nearly double the gains recorded for the benchmark Hang Seng Index .HSI. The Hong Kong bank announced plans to review its 75.6 percent holding in Tricor in February. Hong Kong port operator NWS Holdings Ltd, backed by billionaire Cheng Yu-tung, owns the remaining stake and is also considering selling out. Like several other financial institutions, Bank of East Asia has been hit by regulatory challenges and a slowdown in the China and Hong Kong economies. The bank posted a 37 percent drop in half-yearly profit last month, hit by a surge in loan impairment losses. It has been looking to sharply cut its operational costs and retreat from non-core businesses to shore up profitability. A deal would mark the first major sale of any business by Bank of East Asia, which was established nearly a century ago. While several Hong Kong-based family-owned banks have sold out due to deteriorating market conditions, Bank of East Asia has survived as an independent bank in a market that is dominated by HSBC (HSBA.L) and Standard Chartered Plc (STAN.L).

    "text": "SAO PAULO Spanish fashion and fragrance firm Puig SA agreed on Tuesday to pay around 500 million reais ($155 million) for a 35 percent stake in Grupo Granado SA, a Brazilian manufacturer and retailer of high-end beauty care goods seeking to expand globally, three people with direct knowledge of the deal said. Under terms of the deal, part of the proceeds will go to the owners of Granado and the rest to the company in the form of a capital increase, said two of the people, who asked not to be identified since the transaction remains private. The deal values Grupo Granado at around 1.42 billion reais, they said. Reuters reported on July 14 that Barcelona-based Puig, the owner of the Carolina Herrera and Jean Paul Gaultier brands, was in advanced talks to buy a stake in Granado. Puig consistently stood out over a number of private-equity firms and strategic rivals that had showed early interest in Granado. Efforts to reach investor relations staff at Rio de Janeiro-based Granado outside business hours were unsuccessful. Calls made to Puig's headquarters went unanswered. The Granado stake could help Puig grow in Brazil, a country of 200 million that ranks as the world's No. 3 cosmetics and beauty care market. A third-generation family-owned business, Puig manages licenses such as Prada and Valentino and markets celebrity fragrances in more than 150 countries. Founded in 1870 by Portuguese pharmacist José Antônio Coxito Granado, Grupo Granado has managed to weather the impact of Brazil's harshest recession in eight decades by targeting sales of the company's glycerin soaps, shave balms, creams, nail polish and body powders to an affluent clientele. Former banker Christopher Freeman, who bought Granado from Coxito Granado's children in 1994, has found in Puig a partner to help bolster an overseas push that began three years ago with the opening of a small shop in Paris. Freeman began to look out for a minority partner around February, the people said, adding that talks with Puig formally started in June. FATHER AND DAUGHTER Granado, which had revenue of 380 million reais last year, has achieved compounded average growth of 20 percent over the past decade. Freeman and Grupo Granado hired the investment-banking units of Itaú Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4.SA) and Grupo BTG Pactual SA (BBTG11.SA) as advisors, Reuters reported in July. BNP Paribas SA advised Puig, one of the people said on Tuesday. Rio de Janeiro-based Eskenasi Pernidji Advogados and São Paulo-based Stocche, Forbes, Padis, Filizzola, Clapis Advogados also acted as legal advisors in the transaction, the same person added. A former Citigroup Inc investment banker, Freeman and his daughter Sissi have spent the past decade honing Grupo Granado's business focus and retro image, represented by vintage logo designs and old-styled store decoration mimicking early 20th century pharmacies. Granado's three divisions run a web of 47 stores across Brazil, a distribution network and a plant where the company's flagship products are manufactured. Granado's most recognized products include Phebo, Brazil's first luxury perfumery and glycerin soap brand, which Freeman bought in 2004. On its part, Puig's presence in emerging markets has grown, helping the company decouple from years of weak growth in Spain. Currently, 47 percent of revenues come from emerging market countries outside of the European Union and North America. Last year, Puig had net income of 126 million euros ($141 million) on revenue of 1.645 billion euros. Puig expects annual revenue to reach 2 billion euros by the end of next year. "

    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO Chinese property-to-entertainment conglomerate Dalian Wanda is in talks to buy a controlling stake in Dick Clark Productions, the company that runs the Golden Globe awards and Miss America pageants, as it expands a growing Hollywood portfolio. Run by China's richest man, Wang Jianlin, Wanda already owns Legendary Entertainment, co-producer of film hits such as \"Jurassic World\" - which was the biggest U.S.-China movie deal when it was sealed in January. It also owns U.S. cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC.N). A source familiar with deal said Wanda was looking to bid $1 billion for the TV production company, but cautioned the deal was not yet certain. The person could not be named as the deal value is not public. \"Dick Clark Productions and Beijing Wanda Culture Industry Group Co., Ltd., have agreed to enter into exclusive talks with the shared goal of finalizing a mutually satisfactory transaction,\" a spokesman for Eldridge Industries, the owner of Dick Clark Productions, said in an emailed statement. He declined to comment on the deal value. Wanda declined to comment on Tuesday. Last month, however, Wang told Reuters he expected to seal two billion-dollar deals in the U.S. this year. He aims to bring Hollywood technology and muscle to China, and has expressed interest in the so-called \"big six\" Hollywood studios. \"Only the six are real global film companies, while the rest are not. If we are to build a real movie empire, this is a necessary step,\" Wang said then. Revenue from Wanda's cultural division, which also includes its growing tourism business, theme parks and sports, is expected to grow at least 30 percent this year, potentially reaching 70 billion yuan ($10.5 billion), according to Wang. Wanda has said that revenue for the group would amount to 150 billion yuan by 2020, a target that Wang said could be met before then. The acquisition of Dick Clark, an iconic name in Hollywood, would be the latest move to further Wanda's Hollywood ambitions. Wanda announced last week that it will market Sony Pictures' films and co-finance upcoming movie releases of Sony Corp's (6758.T) film unit in China. Reuters first reported in June that Eldridge Industries, the U.S. owner of magazines Billboard and The Hollywood Reporter as well as Dick Clark Productions, had hired investment banks to carry out a review of its media holdings. Based in Santa Monica, California, Dick Clark Productions also produces the Academy of Country Music Awards and the Billboard Music Awards. Investment firm Guggenheim Partners bought Dick Clark Productions in 2012 for about $380 million from RedZone Capital Management, a private equity firm run by Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder.  Last year, Eldridge Industries majority owner and Chief Executive Todd Boehly left Guggenheim, where he served as president, to start his own company that holds these media assets.  "

    "text": "Stewart Information Services Corp (STC.N), one of the largest U.S. title insurers, is close to reaching a deal with activist investor Starboard Value LP over the composition of its board of directors, two people familiar with the matter said. The deal would come as Stewart Information has sought to appease restless investors over its declining revenue. It has already added three new directors over the last three years, eliminated its dual-class shares and raised dividends. The settlement with Starboard would involve replacing four sitting directors of its nine-member board, including cousins Malcolm Morris and Stewart Morris, who served as co-CEOs from 2000 to November 2011, the sources said this week.  Malcolm's son, Matt, is the company's CEO and represents the fifth generation of the company's founding family to lead it. The identities of the two other directors being considered for replacement, and the four new board members who would fill their seats, could not be learned.  The sources declined to be identified because the talks are confidential, and cautioned that the settlement terms could change, or that the deal could be abandoned altogether.  Stewart Information and Starboard declined to comment. Houston-based Stewart Information, which has a market capitalization of $1.1 billion, has been a steady target of activist investors, with Engine Capital LP and Bulldog Investors previously pressuring the company. Starboard, which also cut a deal with Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) earlier this year that gave it seats on the U.S. internet company's board, acquired a 9.9 percent stake of Stewart last month, and said in a regulatory filing it would speak to the company about \"potential business combinations or dispositions.\"  Stewart Information has also been trying to fend off attacks from another hedge fund. In July, Foundation Asset Management disclosed a 5.6 percent stake in the company. It then called for a special meeting to remove Malcolm and Stewart Morris from the board and replace them with two of its nominees.  Foundation's nominees were Ernest Smith, a former executive with Fidelity National Financial, and Roslyn Payne, president of real estate venture capital firm Jackson Street Partners and a former board member at First American Financial Corp. Stewart Information said at the time it would review the request. In August, Stewart Information filed its own preliminary proxy materials asking shareholders to reject Foundation's special meeting request.  "

    "text": "MEXICO CITY Mexico's Jose Cuervo, the world's largest tequila producer, on Tuesday announced its long-awaited initial public offering, which could raise up to $1 billion, another sign of a wider revival in Latin American stock flotations. Cuervo, North America's dominant tequila brand, could generate investor interest by virtue of its two-centuries-old tradition, the fashion for premium tequila at the expense of vodka, as well as a return to growth in the key U.S. market after several years of decline. \"Jose Cuervo has managed to capitalize (on the market) pretty well, mostly because of their brands, but also because it's one of the oldest tequila companies in Mexico,\" said MetAnalisis analyst Gerardo Copca, adding he thought the timing was right to launch an IPO. Copca noted there have been only two or three IPOs in Mexico this year, though the country was one of the few bright spots last year in a generally bleak world climate for stock flotations. Elsewhere in Latin America, the long-dormant Brazilian IPO market has also shown signs of revival. The filing provided few details about the IPO, but a source familiar with the situation suggested the company could seek to raise between $500 million and $1 billion.  The company, known officially as Becle, said the stock sale would be handled by the local units of Morgan Stanley (MS.N), JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Banco Santander (SAN.MC), and local brokerage GBM Grupo Bursatil Mexicano. Along with the Mexico bourse flotation, the company also plans a private placement to investors in the United States, where the tequila market has increasingly been shifting toward high-end 100 percent agave brands. Cuervo, which said in its prospectus that the offering's proceeds will be used to fund organic and external growth, and broaden its portfolio, has also moved toward such premium brands, taking on rivals including Diageo, with which it once had a distribution deal. UK-based Diageo (DGE.L) tried to buy Jose Cuervo in 2012, when analysts valued the company at around $3 billion.  In 2015 Diageo (DGE.L) swapped its Bushmills Irish whiskey brand for Cuervo's 50 percent stake in their Don Julio premium tequila joint venture.  Started by Jose Antonio de Cuervo in the late 1700s before Mexican independence from Spain, Jose Cuervo claims to be North America's oldest continually producing spirits. With origins in the picturesque town of Tequila in Jalisco state, the business is now controlled by the Beckmann family, who married into the Cuervos a century ago. They will remain the majority shareholder after the IPO.  In the filing, the company said it had 2015 sales of nearly 20 billion pesos ($1.02 billion), up about a quarter from 2014. In the first half of 2016, Cuervo had revenue of 12.2 billion pesos, while net profit in 2015 was 5.3 billion pesos.  Cuervo has returned to U.S. growth, rising 3 percent to 3.5 million cases, according to trade publication Shanken News Daily, and remains about two-thirds larger than its closest rivals there, Sauza and Patron.   The company said the United States and Canada represent about two-thirds of its sales, while Mexico generates just over a fifth of revenue. "

    "text": "FRANKFURT Deutsche Boerse's (DB1Gn.DE) expansion plans in Asia have been moved to a side track as the German exchange operator focuses on its $27 billion merger with the London Stock Exchange (LSE.L), three sources familiar with the situation said. China's foreign exchange trading operator CFETS and Deutsche Boerse signed an agreement last October to establish a 50-50 joint venture in Germany to connect their markets and spur product innovation. The plan was to launch the JV this year but this has now been delayed, the people said. \"The project is on ice for now,\" one of the people told Reuters. \"The Chinese side wants to wait to see if and how the merger with the LSE moves ahead.\"  Deutsche Boerse said the project was continuing. The China Foreign Exchange Trade System, a unit of China's central bank, said: \"We have not received information that the other side plans to delay.\" Last year's agreement was signed in Beijing at a ceremony attended by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and China's Premier Li Keqiang and was a key part of Deutsche Boerse's plan to develop business with Asia. Among other things, the JV was aimed at offering renminbi-denominated interest rate and exchange rate products outside mainland China, but the execution of the plans was also very complex, the people said, adding that a fresh start date could be unveiled in the fourth quarter. The German exchange operator has already faced a setback in its plans to establish its Eurex Asia derivatives exchange and clearing house, which last year was put off until 2017 because of financial market turbulence and software problems. The Eurex Asia timetable has also moved further down the priority list as the LSE merger takes precedence, one of the sources said. European Commission competition authorities are expected to give their first assessment of the Deutsche Boerse-LSE merger on Wednesday or Thursday. Deutsche Boerse has already said it expects regulators to say they will need several more months for an in-depth review of competitive implications of the merger.  "

    "text": "NEW YORK Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), which was considering splitting itself for more than two years, said on Monday it would not do so, prompting shareholders to expect more deals that could bolster its roster of new medicines.   The largest U.S. drugmaker said its lengthy analysis determined that splitting off its low-growth generics from its patent-protected branded products would not boost cash flow or better position the businesses competitively. The move would also disrupt operations, have inherent costs and fail to deliver any tax efficiencies, the company said. \"I never saw the logic behind a split-up,\" said portfolio manager Les Funtleyder of E Squared Asset Management, which owns Pfizer shares. Buying and developing new drugs in oncology and other therapeutic areas is the key to growth for the company, he said.  \"We'd rather see them do some bolt-ons in the $1-to-$10-billion range, which are easily doable for Pfizer,\" he said.  Pfizer will keep the generics and branded medicines as separate divisions, saying it retains the option to split later if \"factors materially change at some point in the future.\" Portfolio manager Jeff Jonas of Gabelli Funds, which holds Pfizer shares, said he expected to see deals that could add future branded products, particularly in the highly lucrative oncology area. He cited the recent success of Pfizer's internally developed Ibrance breast cancer drug. Jonas expects Pfizer to follow its decision to buy Medivation Inc MDVN.O for $14 billion with more deals of \"that size or smaller.\" It bought Medivation for its blockbuster prostate cancer drug Xtandi.  Pfizer's $160 billion deal to buy Irish drugmaker Allergan Inc (AGN.N) collapsed in April after a change in U.S. law had negated the tax benefits for companies moving corporate headquarters overseas.  Investors said they did not believe Pfizer's current strategy includes any Allergan-sized deals. Pfizer said the decision against a split would not affect its 2016 financial forecast. Its shares were down 2.1 percent at $33.55 in afternoon trading, amid a 1.5 percent decline in the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of large drugmakers .DRG. Investors had been expecting the company to step back from the split, Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note.  Pfizer began openly planning for a possible split in early 2014, saying it would track the two divisions' progress for three years before reaching a decision. In August, it said it would decide by year-end. The company had considered the split largely because its patent-protected medicines routinely enjoyed sales growth while demand for its generics typically declined. However, Pfizer's $15 billion purchase of Hospira a year ago bolstered the company's wide array of generics, such as the once top-selling cholesterol drug Lipitor. Hospira makes generic injectable hospital products and biosimilars, which are cheaper versions of the world's leading biotech drugs.   Annual sales of Pfizer's generic portfolio should grow by a  single-digit percentage rate in coming years, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note. He forecast a 3 percent rise in the company's overall annual sales through 2020, resulting in 8 percent earnings growth. "

    "title": "Twitter could take many forms, depending on new owner",
    "date": "Tue Sep 27, 2016 | 12:47 PM EDT",
    "authour": " Reporting by Liana B. Baker in San Francisco; Additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington and Deborah Todd in San Francisco; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Bill Rigby",
    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO With speculation mounting that Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) will soon have a new corporate owner, the 10-year-old social networking service - which has long struggled to define its core purpose -may end up heading in one of several distinctly different directions depending on who ends up paying for it. Companies including Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N), Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google have shown interest in Twitter, which is working with investment banks to evaluate its options, according to people familiar with the matter. With Salesforce.com, Twitter might turn its focus to customer service communications and mining its database of tweets for business intelligence. Google would likely be most interested in the social and news dimensions of Twitter. Disney, by contrast, might see it as a way to expand the reach of its sports and entertainment programming. It is not clear how quickly Twitter might approach a sale, but it is moving to formalize the process, sources have said. A deal is by no means assured in light of the company's uncertain financial prospects and steep price tag - its market value is more than $16 billion after talk of a sale drove the stock up over the past few days. Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey, speaking at a conference in Washington on Monday, declined to comment on possible sale talks. CORPORATE ROUTE? Salesforce.com, run by CEO Marc Benioff, is focused on cloud-based sales and marketing software; unlike Twitter, its main product is aimed at businesses users, not consumers. Under Salesforce.com, Twitter could become a corporate tool used to power sentiment analysis and nurture customer relationships.  Salesforce.com already uses the Twitter \"firehose\" for its new artificial intelligence platform, Einstein. \"It would give them the social graph and a better idea of how social media relates to its customers,\" said Ryan Holmes, chief executive of Hootsuite, a private technology firm that helps brands and consumers manage their social media accounts. Holmes also said that if Salesforce.com owned all of Twitter's data, it could have better insights into what sort of conversations companies such as airlines or telecom firms might be having with their customers and thereby gain more understanding of their business challenges. But many Twitter users - especially newer ones - are not active tweeters, which over time could limit the value of the data Twitter can provide. Salesforce.com could also likely gain much of the benefit of Twitter's data from licensing its trove of tweets as opposed to buying the whole company. Salesforce.com investors are already spooked by the speculation it could acquire Twitter: its shares are down 6  percent since news of the company's interest flared up last week.  GOOGLE AD PLAN  Twitter would fit easily with Google's online advertising-driven business model. Ads could be sold across paid search, YouTube, display and mobile on Twitter - while filling a gap for Google, which has struggled with social media. \"Google already has the eyeballs with advertisers. Cross-selling to the Twitter inventory could be an amazing play for them,\" Hootsuite's Holmes said. Google, which has expertise in monitoring its video service YouTube, would know how to deal with the tricky policy issues facing Twitter, such as abusive tweets and censorship. Still, such a tie-up faces potentially fatal regulatory hurdles, analysts said. In Europe, where the company has a bigger share of the search market than in the United States, the company is already facing two antitrust investigations. \"Google could help Twitter's user acquisition problem. The unknown is whether regulators in the United States and European Union would allow the transaction,\" said BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield. Facebook Inc (FB.O), meanwhile, has been trying to replicate Twitter on its own platform and could also face antitrust challenges if it tried to buy the company, Greenfield said. So far Facebook has not been mentioned as a potential buyer, but with its large cash reserves and penchant for surprise moves it cannot be counted out. THE MEDIA PLAY Twitter's foray into live streaming of National Football League games and its presence in news gathering could interest media companies such as Disney, which owns sports channel ESPN. Twitter's presence on mobile devices could help any media company, all of which are struggling to find mobile growth, according to BTIG's Greenfield. No media company has a mobile product with as much reach as Twitter, he noted.   \"The world of media is shifting to mobile and these newer platforms are becoming the future,\" Greenfield said.  Still, media companies do not have the best track record with social media. News Corp's (NWSA.O) acquisition of MySpace in 2005 ended in disaster. And some question whether the media companies and top personalities that have been so important to Twitter would stick around if a rival media firm were the owner. "

    "text": "LONDON Spain's Telefonica (TEF.MC) is looking to list about 30 percent of its British mobile unit O2 in what would be one of the biggest initial public offerings (IPOs) on the London market this year, sources told Reuters. Europe's biggest telecom group wants to use the relative market calm after the turmoil caused by June's Brexit vote to cut its stake in Britain's second-largest mobile firm and has hired UBS (UBSG.S), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Barclays (BARC.L) as global coordinators for an IPO which could value O2 at about 10 billion pounds ($13 billion), the sources said. An O2 spokesman referred to a Sept. 5 statement by Telefonica when it said it was considering \"various strategic options\" for O2, including an IPO and that \"preparatory work\" had begun. Telefonica had no comment, while Barclays and Morgan Stanley declined to comment and UBS was not immediately available for comment. Telefonica boss Jose Maria Alvarez-Pallete has asked the banks to speed up the preparatory work, hoping to list O2 in December if market conditions allow, the sources said. They ruled out a listing in November as the deal remains in the early stages and the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8 is seen as a potential trigger for market turmoil. \"They are hoping to list O2 at the beginning of December, but Telefonica doesn't want to take unnecessary risks if market conditions deteriorate,\" one of the sources said. The deal may be delayed to the first quarter of 2017 in the event of market uncertainty. TAKEOVER BID? Telefonica has been reviewing strategic options for O2 since a 10.3 billion pound sale to CK Hutchison Holdings (0001.HK) was blocked by Europe's antitrust watchdog in May. On Sept. 5, chairman Alvarez-Pallete said the company was close to taking a decision on either a partial sale or a listing which was to take place before early 2017. Telefonica has decided to retain control of O2 rather than sell it all, despite its efforts to cut down its 50 billion euros of debt, the sources said. O2, which has more than 25 million customers, has long been on the radar screen of private equity funds, but their ambitions were stymied by Britain's vote to leave the EU. A minority stake listing would still leave the door open for Liberty Global (LBTYA.O) or another player to launch a takeover bid, another source said, adding that Liberty's John Malone has yet to decide on his next move in Britain. European listings have recently picked up after a slowdown in capital market deals, mainly due to jitters over Brexit. On Sept. 23 Danish card payment services company Nets NETStemp.CO finalised a $4.5 billion listing four days earlier than planned, as demand exceeded expectations. British fitness club chain Pure Gym (IPO-GYM.L) Group said earlier this month that it had resumed plans to list in London, hoping to raise about 190 million pounds. And Telefonica is also in the process of floating a minority stake of at least 25 percent in its telecoms masts business Telxius IPO-TT.MC.   "

Zhang said there were no plans for an initial public offering for the group. Founded in 2007, Envision Energy is the world's eight-largest wind turbine maker -- behind players such as Vestas (VWS.CO), Siemens (SIEGn.DE) and General Electric (GE.N) -- and has annual sales of about $2 billion. Globally, the group's software systems manage renewable energy assets worth 50 gigawatts, of which about 6-8 GW are located in Europe, Zhang said.

Wolseley, which makes about 80 percent of its profit in the United States, said the 80 branch closures would take two or three years, resulting in restructuring charges of about 100 million pounds ($130 million).

Private equity firms have seen growth in returns on Chinese investments slow along with an economy which in the second quarter expanded at its weakest pace since the 2008-09 global financial crisis. To offset the impact of the slowdown, investors have been targeting companies in high-growth sectors such as e-commerce. As the value of such companies soar in line with global trends, investors who usually have to settle for minority stakes are increasingly seeking to have a greater say in their holdings, said X.D.

Last year, the total value of deals reached $60 billion, the data showed. Control buyouts reached 23 percent of all private equity deals in China last year, compared with 44 percent for the region, the data showed.

As the economy slows, Yang said, conglomerates might seek to sell underperforming businesses while smaller or family-owned firms might be more willing to relinquish control to deep-pocketed investors. Elsewhere, firms seeking expansion might opt for control buyouts to quickly offset the impact of the slowing economy. Investors may also be spurred on by increased credit for leveraged buyouts - in China, a relatively new way to finance deals that came to the forefront in 2013, when a Carlyle-led consortium bought display advertising firm Focus Media for $3.7 billion in the country's biggest-ever leveraged buyout. \"Many years ago there was no leverage finance in China, no Chinese banks were willing to do leverage financing.

Neoen is one of several upstart French renewable energy companies that has become big enough to have good access to financing, offering investors a chance to bet on the disruption of former monopolist EDF's (EDF.PA) centralized business model.

It is either an IPO or a new minority shareholder, it could be both,\" he said in an interview. Jacques Veyrat, former chief executive of commodities giant Louis Dreyfus who owns 56 percent of Neoen through his investment vehicle Impala, wants to remain the largest shareholder, Barbaro said. Infrastructure fund Omnes Capital owns 24 percent and French state fund Bpifrance owns 14 percent. Six percent is set aside for staff and management.  Depending on business conditions in coming years, the IPO or stake sale could value Neoen at over 1 billion euros following the capital increase, Barbaro said.  By the end of this year Neoen will have 1 GW - the equivalent of a nuclear reactor - installed or under construction, of which 600 MW in France, 300 MW in Australia, 100 MW in El Salvador. Its assets are 65 percent in solar, the rest mainly in wind. Neoen wants to keep about 80 percent of its investments in OECD countries, but has projects in several emerging markets. It won a 50 MW solar contract in Zambia in a tender organized by the World Bank's International Finance Corporation, where Italy's Enel (ENEI.MI) - one of its biggest competitors along with French Engie (ENGIE.PA) - won the other contract.  Barbaro said the IFC helped organize the tender, validated the power purchase agreements and provided debt financing. Neoen says it will sell power at $61 per megawatthour, compared to the average $200 paid in Zambia for power generated with diesel or imported. In Jamaica, where Neoen lost a first tender in 2012, it won a tender for a 49 MW solar project near Savanna-la-Mar. There too its solar panels are highly competitive compared to diesel.  Neoen also seeks contracts with companies. In Jordan, it won a tender for 37 MW of solar to sell power to telecoms group Orange (ORAN.PA) and in Australia it built a 10 MW off-grid solar plus battery storage facility for copper miner Sandfire Resources (SFR.AX) on an isolated site hundreds of kilometers from the nearest grid.  Barbaro said that despite Neoen's recent acquisitions of renewables companies Poweo EnR and Juwi France, it is not counting on acquisitions to reach its 2 GW target.  \"We don't rely on M&A, organic growth is the plan,\" he said.  With an average cost of about $1 million per MW of wind or solar and equity finance of 20-25 percent per project, Neoen needs 60-70 million euros of new capital per year, which so far has been provided by its shareholders and from power sales proceeds.  Unlike some of its competitors, it develops most of its own projects and rarely sells stakes, living mainly from the sale of power, which is a capital-intensive business. Neoen had 2015 revenue of 45 million euros and expects 90 million in 2016 but its profit is set to be stable at around 1 million euros as it invests anything above that level in new development.  Neoen also operates a 15 MW biomass facility but Barbaro says he does not see much growth in biomass, as its costs are not coming down as quickly as solar and wind, the plants are complex to operate and sourcing fuel requires active management.  Neoen this year also pulled out of a French offshore wind project with Engie and sold its minority stake to state bank Caisse des Depots. Barbaro said the project was too big for Neoen, which prefers to have majority control over its projects. "

    "text": "HONG KONG Business development managers at Chinese state-owned firms have been put on notice: mess up on M&A deals and you can be held personally liable - for life. Under new rules unveiled by China's State Council, or cabinet, last month, managers will be held accountable if they \"fail to, or incorrectly, perform their duties\" with respect to deals that result in a loss of state assets.  A lack of specifics has prompted bankers and lawyers to say this is a draconian catch-all clause that is already slowing deal-making at Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Sanctions include pay cuts, disciplinary action or full judicial hearings - even years after managers have moved jobs or retired. In the United States and Europe, company executives are rarely held personally accountable, let alone criminally liable, for bad deals - provided they met their fiduciary duties. When strategic moves go bad, typically the CEO or chairman is urged to resign. The move is part of President Xi Jinping's overhaul of China's bloated, debt-ridden SOEs, which have been on a buying binge in recent years. Sloppy deal-making has led to billions of dollars in writedowns.  Flush with state funds and a government mandate to go global, SOE managers have enjoyed a high degree of freedom to make often big, headline-grabbing outbound deals without fear of personal reprisal.  In the rush to accumulate assets, business development teams weren't always thorough in their due diligence or market analysis. And deals were typically rubber-stamped by boards that tended not to look too closely at the details or valuations, said bankers and lawyers who have worked on state sector deals.  State firms also paid less attention to integrating newly bought assets - often critical to delivering long-term value. \"There's growing concern around SOE investments,\" said Xiong Jin, international partner at law firm King & Wood Mallesons in Beijing. \"The government has realized that many SOE assets have been lost through poor investments overseas, and now there's a sense of urgency to impose better controls. This also comes in the broader context of SOE reform.\" The new rules mean many SOE managers are now reluctant to take decisions, say bankers and lawyers, and can spend weeks tied up on email chains and meetings trying to get their bosses to take responsibility for transactions and have external legal counsel sign off on commercial aspects of deals. \"The blanket reaction from senior company officials would be: be passive, making no suggestions or decisions on M&A opportunities,\" said a senior official at a state energy company involved in overseas investment.  The official, who didn't want to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue, said managers would now more likely just report public information about investment opportunities to their bosses, without making any value-added proposals. \"If you start looking through the lens of this document, an SOE manager will start to ask of every operational decision or small decision on every provision in a deal: 'could I be held accountable for this in 15 years' time',\" said Andrew McGinty, partner at law firm Hogan Lovells in Shanghai. \"They will either take the path of least personal risk, which may not be best for the business, or keep going up the chain of command to make sure they have covered their position. This is slowing down deals.\" LEADING THE CHARGE With Beijing's blessing, state-owned firms led China's decade-long outbound M&A splurge, buying strategic assets from energy and food to technology. State-owned firms accounted for close to two-thirds of China's $677 billion in outbound deals over the past 10 years, Thomson Reuters data show. It wasn't always money well spent. For example, a tie-up between China's state-run TCL and France's Thomson Electronics lost around half its value, and South Korean car maker Ssangyong Motor filed for bankruptcy within five years of being taken over by Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp. And last year's oil price collapse forced companies like China Petroleum & Chemical Corp (600028.SS) (0386.HK) and CNOOC (0883.HK) to take billions of dollars in writedowns. CNOOC took a 10.4 billion yuan ($1.56 billion) impairment charge in the first half of this fiscal year, which analysts say is largely related to its $15.1 billion buy of Canada's Nexen Inc in 2013 Bankers said Beijing became even more circumspect following China National Chemical Corp's [CNNCC.UL] $43 billion bid for Syngenta (SYNN.S) in February - which came with an eye-popping $3 billion break fee, or 7 percent of the deal value compared to 1-2 percent typically. \"It's this over-exuberant climate that has prompted the government to rein in the excess,\" said Howard Yu, professor at Swiss business school IMD. \"It all points to an urgent need for systematic reform to impose a sense of discipline when it comes to international expansion through M&A.\" The State Council Information Office, the public relations arm of the central government, did not respond to requests for comment. China's State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), which oversees SOEs, is also tightening its vetting process on outbound deals and intervening more, said M&A bankers in Hong Kong. At some SOEs, internal committees representing the Communist Party have been given new powers to effectively supersede the board and approve major deals. Sinochem International Corp (600500.SS) pulled out of a $3 billion acquisition of a German company last month after the SASAC questioned the valuation, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.  The SASAC did not respond to requests for comment. ($1 = 6.6707 Chinese yuan renminbi) "

    "text": "ForeScout Technologies Inc has interviewed investment banks in recent weeks to hire underwriters for an initial public offering that could value the U.S. network security company at as much as $1 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. ForeScout's IPO plans are a further sign of a rebound in the IPO market in the United States. Not a single U.S. technology company went public between January and late April due to stock market jitters. The IPO could come later this year, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is not public. A representative for ForeScout declined to comment.  Based in San Jose, California, ForeScout provides software to companies that allow them to see in real time every single device connected to their networks and ensure this is done securely. Founded in 2000 by Israeli entrepreneurs, its products are used by over 2,000 companies and government organizations.  ForeScout's IPO would come as similar offerings have failed to live up to their promise, amid fierce competition in the sector. Shares of peers FireEye Inc and SecureWorks Corp, which went public earlier this year, continue to trade below their IPO prices. ForeScout CEO Mike DeCesare said earlier this summer that the stock performance of SecureWorks' shares had prompted the wider cyber security industry to reevaluate its IPO plans. However, some cyber security companies have also sold themselves for top dollar. Blue Coat Systems Inc, which had been planning to go public earlier this year, was sold by private equity firm Bain Capital LLC to Symantec Corp in a $4.65 billion cash deal last month. So far this year, there have only been 13 technology IPOs, raising $1.9 billion, less than half the $4.6 billion raised last year, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Still, the window may be cracking open. Last week, eight IPOs priced, raising a total of $1.3 billion. Two of these IPOs were technology companies, including ad tech company Trade Desk Inc, which priced its $84 million IPO at the high-end of its indicated range.  ForeScout has raised a total of $121 million in eight rounds of funding. It most recently raised $76 million at a $1 billion valuation in January. Its investors include Accel Partners, Amadeus Capital, Meritech Capital Partners and Pitango Venture Capital. "

    "text": "MILAN Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI) said on Monday it was considering a voluntary conversion of its debt into equity as the Italian lender mulls its options to prevent its centuries-old business from being wound down. Sources told Reuters last month that Monte dei Paschi may convert the bulk of its subordinated debt into equity to cut back a planned five billion euro ($5.63 billion) capital increase and make it more attractive for investors. The bank's fragile state poses a threat to confidence in other Italian lenders and even to heavily-indebted Italy, the euro zone's third-largest economy. Italy's third-largest bank and the world's oldest, announced the share sale in July as part of a wider bailout plan to clean up its balance sheet after emerging as the weakest lender in a health check of 51 European banks.  The company added on Monday that a new business plan would be approved on Oct. 24, while a shareholder meeting would be held before the end of November.   The proposed timetable suggests that Monte dei Paschi is trying to carry out the planned share issue before the end of this year and limit the uncertainty over the bank's future.  This may be complicated by the fact that a referendum over Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's flagship constitutional reform will be held on Dec. 4.  The fate of the Italian government likely hinges on its outcome, and political instability in case of a 'No' vote could overshadow Monte dei Paschi's fundraising efforts.   Italian daily Corriere della Sera said on Saturday that four Qatari funds were ready to take up 250 million euros each of the planned capital increase. The bank declined to comment on the report.  The Tuscan lender has been facing a considerable challenge in convincing investors to back its third recapitalization in as many years, and the report lifted Monte dei Paschi shares on Monday. The stock closed up 1.43 percent at 0.19 euros.  There is growing concern among European regulators that the cash bid will fall short and that the Tuscan lender may have to turn to the government for support, three euro zone officials with knowledge of the matter have told Reuters.

Innogy will issue 55.6 million of new shares while parent RWE aims to sell as many as 83.3 million existing shares at a price of between 32 and 36 euros apiece.

    "text": "LONDON Baltic Exchange shareholders approved on Monday an 87 million pound ($112 million) takeover by Singapore Exchange (SGXL.SI) for one of London's oldest institutions, in a deal giving SGX access to the multi-billion-dollar freight derivatives market. As the global shipping industry struggles with poor market conditions, SGX offered - after months of talks - Baltic shareholders 160.41 pounds per share.  Shareholders will receive separately 19.30 pounds per share from the unlisted Baltic as a final dividend, giving the privately owned business a total valuation of about 87 million pounds.  At its general meeting, 95 percent of those voting, or 228 shareholders, approved the deal. Many of the Baltic's shareholders are in the shipping industry and include ship brokers, companies and individuals. \"This is about people actually taking a step back and saying is this a fair and appropriate way of moving the Baltic forward?\" Outgoing Baltic chief executive Jeremy Penn told Reuters.  \"Had the shareholders and members felt this was a bad deal, a bad thing, they would still have turned it down,\" he said. The takeover, unanimously recommended by the Baltic's board last month, is one of the latest developments in a long string of mergers, bidding wars and failed deals among global exchanges. SGX is looking to expand its global presence in shipping and has been developing Asian pricing benchmarks for commodities such as iron ore, liquefied natural gas and coking coal. \"We now look forward to completing the transaction and realising the growth opportunities as we bring together two important maritime centres,\" SGX CEO Loh Boon Chye said in a statement.  The deal will need regulatory approval, which shipping industry sources say is likely to be given. The Baltic also named Mark Jackson its new CEO. Jackson, currently chief commercial officer of AM Nomikos Group and a former chairman and director of the Baltic Exchange, is expected to take up his appointment early in 2017.     Founded in 1744 as a forum for chartering vessels, the Baltic Exchange now produces benchmark indexes for global shipping rates and owns a trading platform for the freight derivatives market.  The Singapore Exchange, started in 1999, made its offer despite freight costs remaining under pressure, after a slump in commodity markets coincided with an increase in the number of vessels. The Baltic Exchange has been located in the heart of the City of London since its founding in a coffee house. Its later flagship building was extensively damaged in an Irish Republican Army bomb attack in 1992. It moved to different premises and the Gherkin tower now stands on the site. The London Metal Exchange (0388.HK), CME Group (CME.O), ICE (ICE.N), state-run conglomerate China Merchants Group [CNMGP.UL] and Platts were among other potential bidders, sources told Reuters previously.

The company named Stephen Chazen, former chief executive of Occidental Petroleum Corp, and Peter Ragauss, former chief financial officer of Baker Hughes Inc, to its board. Williams said it expects to name two new independent directors by the annual shareholders' meeting and that three directors, who served prior to 2016, will not stand for re-election.  Corvex, which is run by Keith Meister, said it welcomed the changes to Williams' board and withdrew its plan to unseat the board. The New York hedge fund is Williams' fourth-largest shareholder. Williams appointed three new directors on Sept. 15, and has promised to add two more, meaning that seven of the company's 11 board members will eventually be new. \"Though the stock could still use some help, this looks like a successful outcome for Keith Meister’s hedge fund,\" said Don Bilson, head of event-driven research at Gordon Haskett. Just before Williams' board nomination deadline for its Nov. 23 meeting, Meister proposed 10 of his employees as nominees to serve as directors. Meister promised to replace the employees with experienced industry professionals, in a rare proxy fight tactic known as a placeholder slate. Meister, previously a Williams director, resigned in June, along with five others, after failing to oust Williams CEO Alan Armstrong. The resignations came a day after Energy Transfer Equity walked away from its more than $20 billion deal to buy Williams.  "

    "text": "MILAN Italian bank UniCredit (CRDI.MI) is looking to raise as much as 16 billion euros ($18 billion) via a share issue and asset sales that are likely to include online broker FinecoBank (FBK.MI), two sources familiar with the matter said. Italy's biggest bank by assets has started gathering offers for its Pioneer asset management arm and is in talks with Poland's PZU to sell a 40 percent stake in Bank Pekao PEO.WA as it seeks to limit the size of a multi-billion share sale. UniCredit's capital ratios lag those of several peers and will be further eroded by the planned sale of a large chunk of its 51 billion euro portfolio of loans to insolvent borrowers. One of the sources said the bad loan sale was crucial in determining the size of UniCredit's capital needs - as loans are generally sold below their book value, forcing a loss on the seller. The Italian press has reported UniCredit could sell 20 billion euros in gross bad loans. UniCredit declined to comment. Back in August, sources had said UniCredit's estimated capital shortfall totaled 7-8 billion euros. \"UniCredit is working on the sale of Pekao, Fineco and Pioneer to cap the capital increase at 5-6 billion euros,\" the first source said, indicating asset sales could fetch as much as 10 billion euros. UniCredit's stake in Pekao is worth 3.1 billion euros at current market prices and its 55 percent holding in Fineco 1.7 billion euros. Sources have said UniCredit wants to pocket 3 billion euros from Pioneer.  The lender, which in July launched a strategic review of all its assets under new CEO Jean Pierre Mustier, is also carrying out smaller disposals such as last month's 500 million euro sale of its card processing activities. A second source said there was a \"high likelihood\" FinecoBank would be put on the block. But analysts see a significant hurdle to a possible sale because FinecoBank reaps roughly half of its revenues from 9 billion euros in bonds it bought from UniCredit.  The bonds are not risk weighted at present because UniCredit controls FinecoBank, and so do not count towards regulatory measures of FinecoBank's leverage or risk concentration, the analysts say. This would change under a new owner, potentially weighing on FinecoBank's valuation, they add. One of the sources said UniCredit would quickly proceed with the capital increase after unveiling a new business plan in late November to avoid overlaps with a rival share sale by Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI).

The offer, which values the No. 2 stock exchange operator in the United States by volumes at about $32.50 per share, comes just over five months after BATS made its market debut at $22.88. BATS shares were down about 1 percent in premarket trading on Monday, while those of CBOE were down more than 2 percent. CBOE owns the Chicago Board Options Exchange and has an exclusive licensing deal on the S&P 500 index options contract through 2032. The exchange also has rights to the popular VIX volatility index. The deal will help CBOE to add more asset classes and boost its position in the European market, where BATS owns the largest stock exchange. CBOE said it expects to use BATS' trading technology and will migrate all trading to a single platform. CBOE's acquisition of BATS is the latest in a string of mergers, bidding wars and failed deals among global exchanges in an industry that has been trying to consolidate for years. BATS itself merged with Direct Edge in 2014 to become the second-largest U.S. stock exchange operator. Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O) said in March it was buying U.S. options exchange operator International Securities Exchange for $1.1 billion from Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1Gn.DE). CBOE Chief Executive Edward Tilly will lead the combined company and CFO Alan Dean will be the finance head. The combined company will be based in Chicago, with offices in Kansas City, New York and London. The deal is expected to add to CBOE's adjusted earnings per share in the first year following the closure, likely in the first half of 2017. CBOE expects to maintain its dividend but may suspend its share repurchase program, a company executive said on a conference call following the announcement of the deal. BofA Merrill Lynch and Broadhaven Capital Partners LLC are financial advisers to CBOE Holdings. Sidley Austin LLP is CBOE's legal counsel. Barclays Capital and UBS Investment Bank are financial advisers to BATS, while Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP is its legal counsel. "

    "text": "BEIJING China has launched a 350 billion yuan ($52.5 billion) state enterprise restructuring fund to advance its 'supply-side' reforms as the world's second-largest economy undergoes its most significant transformation in two decades. China has made reform of its lumbering and uncompetitive state-owned enterprises (SOEs) a priority as weak global demand drags on economic growth and excess capacity and idle workers bleed what precious resources companies have at their disposal. Earlier this year, China said it was planning to allocate 100 billion yuan to help local authorities and SOEs finance layoffs in its struggling coal and steel industries. Up to 1.8 million people in the sectors could lose their jobs, official estimates showed. The capital raised by the China State-owned Enterprises Restructuring Fund will focus on boosting the competitiveness of some SOEs and their international operations, including overseas acquisitions, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), which will manage the fund, said in a document. \"Among SOEs controlled by the central government, some have excess capacity while others are suffering from a severe lack of capacity,\" state radio cited Xiao Yaqing, head of SASAC, as saying on Monday. \"Setting up this new fund will help concentrate state capital on strategic and forward-looking industries.\" The fund will have an initial registered capital of 131 billion yuan provided by 10 SOEs. The 10 firms investing in the fund include China Mobile Ltd (0941.HK), China Railway Rolling Stock Corp (601766.SS) and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp (600028.SS). Key investment areas of the fund include assets pertaining to national security and are of economic importance such as strategic reserves of natural resources, oil-and-gas pipelines, power grids and telecommunication infrastructure, according to the SASAC document. The fund will also focus on restructuring SOEs. For some sectors like coal and steel, restructuring has meant closures of mines and plants, and layoffs. For others, it has meant high-profile marriages to create national champions with the heft to compete globally. Last year, Beijing ordered the merger of top train manufacturers China CNR Corp and China CSR Corp. \"This fund aims to facilitate the destocking and deleveraging process,\" said Zhou Hao, senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank. China's state sector employed around 37 million people in 2013, and accounts for about 40 percent of the country's industrial output. The retrenchments are China's most significant layoffs since the restructuring of SOEs from 1998 to 2003. That round of reforms led to around 28 million redundancies and cost the government about 73.1 billion yuan in resettlement funds. China is not the first country to create a fund to support state firms going through hard times. The South Korean government has approved a $9.5 billion fund to help recapitalize state-run banks exposed to the country's troubled shipping sector. China will reduce the number of SOEs this year to no more than 100 from 106, state media reported in July, citing SASAC Deputy Secretary-General Peng Huagang, who added that 10 central SOEs were in talks to create five groups. China's central SOEs will complete their restructuring by the end of next year by introducing private capital and strategic investment, the Economic Information Daily reported earlier this month, citing unnamed insiders.

Family-owned Standard Industries made its offer of 25 euros ($28.12) in cash per share two weeks ago, valuing Braas at $2.1 billion including debt. The German group opposes the offer, saying it does not include a premium and significantly undervalues the company and its future prospects. It called on shareholders to reject the deal in a letter on Friday. Braas said a merger would deprive shareholders of synergy effects, which would arise from a combination of Braas with European roof tile maker Icopal, a Standard Industries subsidiary. Standard Industries, in a letter to shareholders on Sunday, called Braas's arguments \"misleading\" and \"outright falsehoods\". \"This transaction is not driven by synergies or cost cutting, but rather by the enhanced opportunities to grow together and continue to invest in the business,\" the U.S. company said. Standard also said its offer price fairly reflected Braas Monier's value, following a 2016 full-year growth revisal to 1 percent from a previous 2-3 percent in its second quarter report. "

It marks Dongbei's ninth default of 2016. Owned by the Liaoning provincial government in China's northeast rust belt, Dongbei announced on the website of China's interbank bond market operator that it had failed to pay 744 million yuan of principle and interest on a one-year bond. It had warned earlier in September it was uncertain if it could make payment. [nRSD9sWKbv] Its original default in March helped ignite a selloff in Chinese corporate debt. In recent months, bond prices have rallied, prompting central bank intervention seen by dealers as a sign it is concerned about bond market leverage. [nL3N1BC2YC] Dongbei said on Sept 5 it was delaying the disclosure of its interim financial information as it was in the midst of a debt restructuring plan. Citing a source familiar with the matter, Reuters IFR reported earlier on Monday that the Liaoning government had decided to file for a court-ordered restructuring after creditors rejected an initial proposal to swap debt for equity. [nL3N1C21K8] Many of China's corporate debt problems can be found in the northeast, the home of the country's steel industry and a region heavily dependent on the big industry that fuelled China's economic expansion. Now Beijing is pushing to shut surplus capacity and reform inefficient state enterprises. In May, a Reuters analysis of central bank data showed that Chinese rust-belt provinces, including Liaoning, had sharply raised their dependence on high-cost \"shadow finance\" in early 2016, as traditional lenders pulled back.

    "text": "CHICAGO The U.S. Justice Department is looking into concerns that global consolidation among major seed and agricultural chemical companies may squeeze supplies of the building blocks for widely used genetically modified seeds, a farm group told Reuters. The department has asked the American Soybean Association for details about how small and independent seed companies license seed traits from developers, said Steve Censky, chief executive of the association.  The federal inquiries started after Dow Chemical said in December that it would seek to merge with DuPont in a $130 billion deal. In recent months, department officials have also asked how farmers select seeds, Censky said. Such questions are common in antitrust reviews, as regulators try to decide whether to approve, reject or place conditions on a merger.  The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment. Smaller companies need to license corn and soybean traits, which can protect against insects and other threats, because they cannot afford the more than $100 million it costs to develop them. Major seed makers often license traits and other genetic material to smaller dealers that have close relationships with farmers and can help place products on more acres. Independent seed sellers said the proposed Dow-Dupont merger could hurt them if the companies decide to hike licensing fees or to keep their best traits for themselves. They have similar concerns about subsequent announcements that Bayer AG would seek to buy Monsanto Co and that Chinese state-owned China National Chemical Corp [CNNCC.UL] aimed to acquire Syngenta AG. All three deals are still pending. \"It's the big question that everybody is looking at right now,\" said Todd Martin, CEO of the Independent Professional Seed Association, about the future of licensing. \"Anything that does not support the expansion of the licensing market, we are against.\" The association has asked Dow and DuPont to expand licensing as part of their merger. The soybean association, which represents more than 20,000 U.S. farmers, told the Justice Department that trait licensing by major companies needs to be preserved, Censky said. LICENSING PLANS UNCERTAIN Unlike Dow, Monsanto, Bayer and Syngenta, DuPont has not been active in licensing traits.  That has raised concerns among small seed companies that a combined Dow-DuPont could pull back on licensing the technology, a prospect Martin said would be \"incredibly negative\" for independent sellers.  Independent companies supply about 20 percent of corn and soybeans seeds in North America, giving farmers choices as they work to boost harvests in a downturn. Without licensing, the number of brands of corn seed would probably drop to less than a dozen from about 200 currently, Martin said. Dow told Reuters it has not made decisions on trait licensing because its deal with DuPont has not been finalized. Monsanto said it was \"too soon to have any of those answers\" about whether its $66 billion acquisition by Bayer would affect licensing. Syngenta said its $43 billion acquisition by ChemChina will not change its licensing conditions. DuPont and ChemChina did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Trait licensing was on the agenda at a U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday, where executives of top companies defended their planned mergers and acquisitions. Bayer CropSciences's CEO told senators it had \"no plans to discontinue\" trait licensing. But Senator Charles Grassley, a Republican from Iowa and the committee chair, was one of several lawmakers who worried the deals would slow innovation in seeds and pest control. Sonny Beck, CEO of Beck's Hybrids, the largest family-owned U.S. seed company, told Reuters the company pays to license nearly all its traits from larger companies, including Dow and Monsanto. \"If they say, 'we're going to keep it all for ourselves,'\" he said, \"that would hurt us.\" "

Lanxess's offer of $33.50 per share is a premium of about 19 percent to the Philadelphia-based company's share-price close on Friday. The world's largest synthetic rubber maker will use existing funds and new debt to buy Chemtura, Lanxess said in a statement, describing the deal as its largest ever acquisition. It is part of its push to diversify away from the synthetic rubber unit, which depends heavily on the car industry and is under pressure from rivals. It agreed to sell a 50 percent stake in that business to Saudi Aramco for 1.2 billion euros last year. Its new core business includes highly specialized substances such as ingredients for drugs and pesticides, leather-tanning chemicals, construction pigments for concrete and roofing tiles, and water treatment chemicals. The Chemtura deal will help it boost its industrial lubricant additives and flame retardant additives businesses. It follows the 2010 takeover of Dutch company DSM for around 310 million euros and Brazilian rubber producer Petroflex in 2008 for 280 million euros. The shares rose 8 percent to their highest in more than a year on Monday, and were the best performers on the European STOXX 600 index . UBS analyst Patrick Rafaisz said the price represented a multiple of 10 over earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and just seven times when including targeted synergies. \"The price paid for expanding is reasonable, in our view, and a refreshing discount to the early- to mid teens multiples that have become more typical in M&A during the last few quarters,\" Rafaisz said. The boards of both companies have unanimously approved the deal, which is expected to close around mid-2017, Chemtura said in a separate statement. Lanxess also said it will no longer pursue its earlier-announced share buy back of around 200 million euros.  Morgan Stanley advised Chemtura on the deal. "

Ping An Insurance Group of China (601318.SS) and Australia's Link Market Services are the other suitors that have placed final bids for the business, called Tricor Holdings, the people added. The deal, if successful, would mark the first major sale of any business by Bank of East Asia, which was established nearly a century ago. While several Hong Kong-based family-owned banks have sold out due to deteriorating market conditions, Bank of East Asia survived as an independent bank in a market that is dominated by HSBC (HSBA.L) and Standard Chartered plc (STAN.L). A sale of Tricor could also help Bank of East Asia management placate some shareholders and win their support in the battle against Elliott, which has called for a sale of the bank itself.  Like several other financial institutions Bank of East Asia has been hit by regulatory challenges and a slowdown in the China and Hong Kong economies. The bank posted a 37 percent drop in half-yearly profit last month, hit by a surge in loan impairment losses. It has been looking to sharply cut its operational costs and retreat from non-core businesses to shore up profitability. Hedge fund Elliott, which owns 7 percent of Bank of East Asia and has been critical of its performance, has been agitating for change and started legal proceedings against the bank in July over a share issue. Bank of East Asia has rejected Elliott's demand that the bank be put up for sale. The Hong Kong bank announced plans to review its 75.6 percent holding in Tricor in February. Hong Kong port operator NWS Holdings Ltd, backed by billionaire Cheng Yu-tung, owns the remaining stake and is also considering selling its holding. Final bids for the business, that generated about $55 million in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization, were due last week. Vistra and Permira are the frontrunners for Tricor, one of the people said. Bank of East Asia, Ping An, Link and Permira declined to comment. Baring Asia Private Equity, which owns Vistra, also declined to comment. Sources declined to be identified as the discussions are confidential.

    "text": "SINGAPORE Singapore's BandLab Technologies will buy 49 percent of Rolling Stone magazine from publisher Wenner Media and plans to expand the business into new markets and boost its profile in Asia, the two companies said in a statement. The acquisition could lift the music magazine's brand in Asia, where its name does not go as far. It also highlights the struggles of the publishing industry as advertising revenues fall in an increasingly competitive online age. BandLab, led and co-founded by Kuok Meng Ru, the 28-year-old son of Singaporean palm oil tycoon Kuok Khoon Hong, is a group of companies making products for music creators and fans. The statement gave no financial details of the deal. \"We see an enormous opportunity to diversify the brand into new markets and new areas of business,\" Gus Wenner, head of digital of Wenner Media, said in the statement. Rolling Stone publishes 12 international editions in Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico and Russia, and says it reaches an audience of over 65 million people. The magazine is also known for edgy reporting typified by correspondents like Matt Taibbi, who skewered Wall Street titans during the global financial crisis, and the late Hunter S. Thompson, originator of the gonzo style of first-person journalism. "

    "text": "Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) has initiated talks with several technology companies to explore selling itself, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday, signaling the start of what is likely to be a slow-rolling auction of the high-profile but money-losing social media company. A sale of Twitter has been the subject of on-again, off-again rumors for many months as the company grapples with stagnant user growth, soft advertising sales and losses running at hundreds of millions of dollars a year. The company's business struggles have come even as the 10-year-old service has evolved into a potent global source of news, entertainment and social commentary.  CNBC, citing anonymous sources, reported on Friday that Twitter is in talks with companies including Google (GOOGL.O) and may receive a formal bid soon. A source told Reuters that Salesforce.com (CRM.N) is also in pursuit.  Twitter and Alphabet Inc, Google's parent company did not respond to a request for comment. Salesforce declined to comment.  Verizon, another company mentioned in media reports on Friday as a possible suitor, said it did not comment on M&A rumors but that it had not submitted a bid for the company.  Twitter shares jumped more than 19 percent to $22.22 per share on Friday, marking the largest one-day rise since their first day of trading in 2013. The company now has a market value of around $16 billion. Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi said Alphabet would be the best acquirer for Twitter since it has not yet been able to crack social media on its own despite several efforts. \"From a strategic standpoint, we think it would be more beneficial for Alphabet as opposed to Salesforce,\" Mogharabi said. Former Google executive Omid Kordestani is executive chairman of Twitter. Morningstar estimates Twitter could be bought for $22 per share. Twitter is working with investment banks Goldman Sachs and Allen & Co in considering possible transactions, sources familiar with the situation said. SALESFORCE SURPRISE The most unexpected development on Friday was Salesforce.com's interest in acquiring Twitter. Salesforce serves business customers with cloud-based computing services and has virtually no presence in consumer media. But a recent presentation about its new \"Einstein\" artificial intelligence platform provided a peak at how Twitter could fit into the company's strategy . Salesforce executives said they license the Twitter \"firehose\" of all Tweets that come through the platform, and use it to power sentiment analysis and other tools that show how companies and brands are being discussed and perceived. Salesforce Chief Executive Marc Benioff is active in political causes in San Francisco and the two companies are located just blocks from each other in the city.  Salesforce's chief digital evangelist, Vala Afshar, tweeted on Friday: \"Why @twitter? 1 personal learning network 2 the best realtime, context rich news 3 democratize intelligence 4 great place to promote others.\" Later, Afshar added: \"I have tweeted my personal views regarding 'Why Twitter?' numerous times over the past couple of years. I simply love Twitter.\" RIVALS ASCEND Afshar's sentiment is not shared on Wall Street, however. Twitter missed Wall Street's sales expectations in both the first and second quarters of 2016, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, and has yet to produce a net profit in 11 quarters as a public company.  As of the end of the second quarter, the company had an accumulated loss of nearly $2.3 billion since its inception. It has also failed to keep pace with rivals, notably Facebook's Instagram and Snapchat. Both now boast more users than Twitter by most measures even though they are much newer, and advertisers have begun to migrate their ad dollars accordingly.  Twitter's revenue grew rapidly under former Chief Executive  Dick Costolo, but stagnant user growth and mounting complaints about lack of innovation in the product led to Costolo's departure last year. The company has also faced criticism for its failure to stem abuse on the platform and for missing the opportunity to play a bigger role in the red-hot messaging arena. Twitter has 313 million monthly users, up just 3 percent from a year ago. Co-founder Jack Dorsey returned to the company as chief executive in 2015 while retaining his role as CEO of payment company Square, and his plan for reviving Twitter is at best seen as unfinished. Recent moves to be a big player in live video, including a deal to broadcast NFL games, are too new to be reflected in user growth or ad sales. Twitter went public in November 2013 at $26 a share. The shares peaked above $74 just over a month after its IPO, but have been on steady downward trajectory since. From then through Thursday's close at $18.63, the stock had lost three-quarters of its value. "

    "text": "CBS Radio Inc, which CBS Corp (CBS.N) is planning to shed, is preparing to take on about $1.5 billion in debt ahead of its initial public offering and use most of the proceeds to pay its parent in cash, according to people familiar with the matter. The IPO for the subsidiary, which owns 117 U.S. radio stations, including in top markets such as New York and Los Angeles, was registered in July with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. CBS has not publicly disclosed how much debt the unit plans to issue.  CBS Radio stated in its IPO registration statement that it would distribute some proceeds from the debt offering to its parent, while keeping some money for general corporate purposes.  CBS's debt offering will be split between bonds and loans, and could come before the end of the year, the sources said this week. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), Bank of America Corp BAML.O and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.S) are underwriters on the IPO, while JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) is leading the bank financing, and Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) is running the bond financing, the sources added. The sources asked not to be identified because the details of the offering were not yet public. Representatives of CBS and all of the banks declined to comment. CBS will use capital from the radio deal for buybacks and investing in the business, CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves told the Goldman Sachs Communacopia Conference this week. Moonves had said that private equity firms, radio rivals and international groups have expressed interest in buying CBS Radio. An IPO, however, is viewed as the most likely option, according to the sources. Speculation has grown among media industry insiders that CBS Corp may merge with Viacom, which has the same controlling shareholder in Sumner Redstone, although CBS CEO Moonves has said that no talks are underway. CBS Radio is profitable and its sports, news and music stations are in top markets such as New York and Los Angeles. But a radio company IPO may be a tough sale as new digital competitors have emerged and depressed advertising sales for the medium for years. Internet radio company Pandora Media Inc (P.N) is taking a small but growing share of the $15 billion to $17 billion in local ad dollars from FM radio per year, Macquarie analyst Amy Yong said in a research note in August. CBS Radio generated revenue of $1.23 billion last year, down from $1.3 billion a year ago, according to the IPO registration. "

    "text": "NEW YORK A potential acquisition by CBOE Holdings Inc (CBOE.O) of Bats Global Markets Inc (BATS.Z) would kick-start the Chicago-based options exchange operator's sluggish growth and give it exposure to new asset classes in the United States and Europe, analysts said on Friday. CBOE is in talks to acquire Bats and may pay for the No. 2 U.S. equities exchange with cash and stock, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. The terms have not been finalized and a deal is not yet certain, the person said. Scooping up Bats would instantly diversify CBOE's business, giving it more sources of revenue across the globe. Shares of Bats were up 20.6 percent and CBOE was up 1.8 percent on Friday afternoon. The talks were first reported by Bloomberg late Thursday. Representatives for CBOE and Bats declined to comment. Earnings growth at CBOE has slowed meaningfully since 2014 while the exchange's value has continued to rise, helped by the value of its proprietary products, said Kyle Voigt, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, who said the deal could be worth $3.2 billion. CBOE owns the Chicago Board Options Exchange and has an exclusive licensing deal on the S&P 500 Index options contract through 2032 and non-exclusive rights through 2033. The exchange also has rights on the popular VIX volatility index.  Those two products now generate more than 80 percent of CBOE's transaction revenue compared to about 50 percent five years ago, said Voigt. Bats merged with Direct Edge in 2014 to become the second-largest U.S. stock exchange operator. The Kansas City, Missouri-based company also owns the largest pan-European stock exchange, a foreign exchange-trading platform, as well as two options exchanges that would give CBOE a more competitive U.S. market position.    Nasdaq Inc announced in March it was buying U.S. options exchange operator International Securities Exchange for $1.1 billion from Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1Gn.DE). The deal solidified Nasdaq as the No. 1 U.S. options exchange operator and it strengthened Deutsche Boerse's hand in a proposed merger with London Stock Exchange Group (LSE.L). CBOE had a 27.78 percent share of the U.S. options market at the end of August, while Bats had 10.6 percent and Nasdaq 35.27 percent, according to the Options Clearing Corporation. "

Alaska Airlines reached an understanding with the U.S. regulator earlier this year not to close the merger prior to Sept. 30, which has not changed, the airline's spokeswoman Bobbie Egan said in a statement. \"Given our largely complementary networks, the relative size of this merger compared to past airline combinations, and both Virgin America and Alaska's reputations for being customer service-focused airlines, we continue to feel confident that the (Justice Department) will agree that our combination will allow us to better compete against the Big Four airlines,\" Egan said, referring to American (AAL.O), Delta (DAL.N), United (UAL.N) and Southwest (LUV.N). Bloomberg News reported earlier Friday that the airlines agreed to delay merger plans to give the U.S. Justice Department additional time, adding that they met with government officials last week to address their concerns about industry competition. Egan said Bloomberg's report that the Justice Department \"can now take several more weeks\" for the review was inaccurate. The Seattle-based company announced its $2.6 billion cash deal for Virgin America in April, which will make it the top carrier on the U.S. West Coast if the merger is approved. Shares of Alaska Air were down less than 1 percent in afternoon trade. "

    "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO Brazil's state-owned oil producer Petrobras agreed to sell 90 percent of a natural gas pipeline unit to a group led by Canada's Brookfield Asset Management Inc (BAMa.TO) for $5.2 billion, the companies said on Friday. The foreign consortium agreed to pay $4.34 billion for Nova Transportadora do Sul SA, or NTS, when the deal closes and $850 million in five years, according to Brookfield and Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known. The investor group includes two sovereign wealth funds, China's CIC Capital Corp and Singapore's GIC Private Ltd. Reuters reported the main terms of the deal between Petrobras and Brookfield, including the sale price, on Sept. 6, citing sources with direct knowledge of the transaction. The sale, which is still subject to approval by shareholders and Brazilian regulators, is the largest yet in a plan by the oil company to sell $15.1 billion of assets in 2015 and 2016 and raise another $19.5 billion through divestment and partnerships between 2017 and 2018. Petrobras preferred shares (PETR4.SA), the company's most-traded class of stock, fell 3 percent in afternoon trading to 13.58 reais in Sao Paulo, as world oil prices slumped on reports Saudi Arabia does not expect the Organization for Petroleum Exporting States, or OPEC, to cut output at a meeting next week. Under the accord, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners Ltd (BIP_pc.TO) will invest at least 20 percent of value of the deal, while Brookfield Asset Management has an initial investment of about 30 percent. NTS transports natural gas in south-central Brazil and provides the country's most populous and industrialized states - Minas Gerais, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro - with natural gas from Bolivia and Brazil's offshore oil and gas fields. Rodrigo Costa, Petrobras' general manager for natural gas, told reporters the sale of NTS will not affect existing natural gas contracts, which expire between 2025 and 2031. He said transport prices for that gas will be set by the contractual terms. Petrobras, though, will not have exclusivity in pipeline usage, Costa noted. Its Transpetro shipping and pipeline company has a management and maintenance contract with NTS that will continue in effect, he added. He also said Petrobras is doing everything it can to make sure the deal closes by the end of this year. "

    "text": "PARIS/MILAN Vivendi (VIV.PA) hopes to make a new offer for Mediaset's (MS.MI) pay-TV business by the end of next week to try to end a dispute between the French and Italian media groups that erupted in July, a source close to matter said. Under the preferred scenario Vivendi is working on, shares of Mediaset Premium would be divided evenly between Vivendi, Mediaset and a third party, which would most likely be an investment fund, the source said on Friday. Another possibility would be for Mediaset and Vivendi to get 40 percent of Premium each with the third party getting the other 20 percent.  Vivendi declined to comment.  \"Several funds have come up,\" the source told Reuters. \"With interest rates at such low levels, finding a willing investor is not the hardest thing here,\" the source said, adding that rebuilding trust with Mediaset was the biggest challenge. In April, the two companies signed an agreement that would have given Vivendi full control of Mediaset's Premium pay-TV division. The deal included a cross-shareholding agreement giving each company a 3.5 percent stake in the other.     But in July, Vivendi, led by billionaire Vincent Bollore, said it only wanted a 20 per cent stake in Premium and planned to buy some 15 per cent of Mediaset over three years.     The French media company, which has vowed to turn itself into a European media powerhouse, said its change of heart reflected differences with Mediaset over the analysis of Premium's financial forecasts.  Mediaset will discuss the disputed deal at a board meeting on Tuesday, a second source familiar with the matter said. \"The board was already scheduled, it's not an extraordinary board meeting called for the issue, but certainly the Vivendi matter will be discussed,\" the second source said.    The Italian company, controlled by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, is suing Vivendi for not following through on the April agreement and estimates damages could come to more than 1.5 billion euros ($1.68 billion) should it collapse. \"Since July there have been no direct contacts with Vivendi,\" the source said, asking not to be named.      A third source close to the matter said while advisers were looking into ways to mediate between the two sides, there was no sign of a possible compromise for the time being.     Vivendi, keen to create a pan-European media and content conglomerate to compete with Rupert Murdoch's Sky (SKYB.L) and video-streaming giant Netflix (NFLX.O), is the biggest shareholder of Italian phone company Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI).

    "text": "Reuters Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing is likely to face significant regulatory hurdles if he bids for a stake in National Grid's (NG.L) British gas networks, banking and industry sources said, because of similar assets he already owns.  Li's Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd (1038.HK) is  preparing a bid for a majority stake in National Grid's four gas distribution networks, whose overall value is up to 11 billion pounds ($14 billion), the Financial Times said. But bankers and industry sources close to the deal strongly questioned CKI's ability to acquire these assets, because the conglomerate already owns stakes in two networks in the U.K. Gaining more control over gas distribution could damage competition, they said. \"Everyone has done a lot of work on this (competition issues) and as a result, we all know it would be incredibly difficult for CKI to buy more networks in the UK,\" said one of the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity because the matter is private.  There are eight main gas distribution networks (GDN) in Britain, covering different regions. National Grid Gas operates networks in East Midlands, West Midlands, northwest England and east England.  CKI became one of the major sector players by acquiring EDF's electricity distribution network in 2010 for 5.7 billion pounds. The group now controls gas distribution in North East England, including Yorkshire and northern Cumbria, as well as Wales and southwest England.  Another major player is SGN, which operates in Scotland and southern England. SGN shareholder SSE (SSE.L) has also put up to a third of its 50 percent stake up for sale. Li Ka-Shing entering the race would be good news for the National Grid as the seller as increased competition could lead to a higher price for what is excepted to be one of the largest infrastructure transaction in the UK this year. So far, two consortia of investors are seen as the main contenders and are expected to submit non-binding bids ahead of a Friday deadline. One consortium is led by Australian fund Macquarie and includes German insurer Allianz, Dalmore Capital and China's CIC; the other is led by Canada's Pension Plan (CPPIB) and comprises sovereign wealth funds from Kuwait and Abu Dhabi. The sale is expected to conclude in the first quarter of next year. A way for the Hong Kong investor to overcome regulatory hurdles would have been to bid only for selected assets, but National Grid has made clear it wants to sell a majority stake of the business in one chunk, the sources said.  CKI, one of the country's largest investors with assets across mobile telecommunication, ports and power, is a well-known figure in the UK and would not face scrutiny from the government, the sources said.  \"The politics would be OK but they is no way regulators would clear that deal,\" said another source involved in the deal and who's worked with Li Ka-Shing on UK deals in the past. \"We have stated in the past that we would advise government and merger authorities if we were concerned that a merger could reduce our ability to regulate effectively,\" said a spokesman for energy regulator Ofgem, which does not have any powers to intervene in the sale directly. National Grid declined to comment. CKI did not immediately reply to a request for comment. "

    "text": "NEW YORK The transatlantic loan markets are facing a busy few weeks as companies accelerate borrowing plans to take advantage of strong and liquid market conditions before running into any potential volatility around the looming US elections on November 8. Borrowers are bringing deals forward amid a noticeable pick-up in activity in the US and Europe since the end of August. A window of opportunity has opened for companies to take advantage of strong bond and loan markets while interest rates are low and credit spreads are tight, which is boosting M&A activity. “Issuers are definitely pulling things forward, no question. There’s a sense of getting deals done now,” a senior loan syndicator said. Bankers are seeing increased M&A activity in the US and Europe for investment grade and leveraged companies, including cross-border deals and a wave of opportunistic repricings, refinancings and dividend recapitalizations for leveraged private equity-owned firms. “Everything went crazy in the last week of August. We’re working on a lot at the moment, definitely more than we’ve had at any other point this year, including some really big and interesting stuff,” the senior loan syndicator said. The upturn in activity is less noticeable in Asia, which has deeper local currency markets and fewer borrowers tapping the US term loan B market than Europe, although Asian borrowers are more focused on Federal Reserve moves that will determine the pricing of future dollar-denominated loans. Increased transatlantic activity, however, coincides with nervousness around the possibility of Republican nominee Donald Trump winning the US presidential election as polls converge and the implications for markets, which are also facing a wave of European elections. “People are nervous about the US elections, no-one’s asking what will happen if Hillary wins, all are asking what will happen if Trump wins,” a senior lawyer said. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is seen as being more in favor of corporate and income taxes with government borrowing for infrastructure and less spending. Trump is less predictable and is expected to spend on infrastructure but get rid of corporate taxation. The US election and raft of European elections in 2016 and 2017 mean that global political considerations are becoming a bigger issue for lending and overshadowing the macroeconomic malaise as central bankers continue to dictate policy. Investors on both sides of the pond are also looking past the US elections to the Federal Reserve’s possible decision to raise interest rates in December. Volatility has picked up in the last few weeks across all risk markets on the fear that quantitative easing and other central bank easing policies might be coming to the end. TIMING CONSIDERATION The window of opportunity is creating a timing issue for underwriting banks, which are finding it hard to predict what the markets will look like after the US election and difficult to predict investor appetite now for deals that will complete later this year or early next year. Deals that were signed over the summer or in recent weeks are likely to close by the US election. But deadlines are likely to stretch on M&A deals where borrowers control the process and bankers need to complete preparation such as ratings work or pro forma accounting. “Borrowers are in control of M&A processes – if it’s an event deal and there’s preparation to be done, unfortunately we’re having to underwrite through that window. The specifics of what happens if either party wins and how the credit markets will react is absolutely part of the discussion,” the senior syndicator said. Although some are comparing the US election result to the brief, if chilling, effect of the Brexit vote on the markets this summer, most concede that the US election is a bigger global issue given the size and strategic importance of the American economy. “I’ve heard some people say ‘business as usual’, but we’ve never had a situation before this polarizing in the US or globally. No-one’s screaming that this is the best thing ever happening,” the senior lawyer said. Deals signed in October or November are unlikely to close until the end of the year or early next year. Although banks are going through credit processes, they are worried about potential turbulence and its effect on investor appetite. “Deals either need to be signed up now or you need to have the book together. If the book is not full up to the election, you have to be questioning whether you can put your book together post-election,” the senior lawyer said. European companies that are planning to issue debt in the US are being advised to do so before October and avoid late November to avoid any volatility and minimize the prospect of hung deals for underwriting banks. “No-one wants to get into a situation where markets and events cause an underwriting to market problem. The markets don’t like uncertainty and there’s quite a lot of risk out there,” the senior syndicator said. Despite the uncertainty, the loan asset class and leveraged loans in particular are still seen as offering good returns given a lack of viable alternatives and investor appetite is strong for now with a supply-demand imbalance in the US and Europe.

    "text": "FRANKFURT Innogy, the renewables, network and retail business of utility RWE, could fetch up to 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) when it lists next month to become Germany's biggest IPO since the tech boom at the turn of the millennium. Reeling from high debt, low wholesale power prices and a rise in renewable power, RWE and larger peer E.ON have come up with competing turnaround plans to split up their businesses. RWE's debt is 28.3 billion euros, E.ON's 25.5 billion. By pooling and listing its healthy assets -- grids, retail and renewables -- as a separate entity, RWE, Germany's second-largest energy group, is hoping to attract investors who have dumped utility stocks in recent years. With its focus on regulated assets, Innogy's business will be similar to that of E.ON, but with one key difference: E.ON, which last week spun off a majority in power plant and energy trading unit Uniper, will still carry the billions of liabilities related to the shutdown of its German nuclear plants. In Innogy's case, that responsibility stays with parent RWE, removing a major uncertainty for potential investors. \"What's clear to me is that E.ON's assets are as good as Innogy's assets. However, there's an overhang for E.ON due to the nuclear legacy issue and a 47 percent share in Uniper, which makes it a less clean story,\" said Oskar Tijs, senior investment analyst at Dutch asset manager NN Investment Partners. Innogy, which would be Germany's largest initial public offering since Deutsche Post went public in 2000, will issue 55.6 million of new shares while parent RWE will put up as many as 83.3 million existing shares for sale at 32-36 euros apiece, it said. This would give it a market capitalization of up to 20 billion euros, more than twice RWE's current value, showing the appetite for regulated assets, which account for 60 percent of its profits, and the discount on RWE's power generation assets. \"Finally, there's something investable in Germany's utility sector,\" Andreas Schneller, fund manager at Swiss utility specialist EIC said, adding he hoped to buy some of Innogy's shares. Innogy said 940 million euros in binding purchases had already been placed and would be acquired by U.S. asset manager BlackRock on behalf of its clients, underlining the level of interest. However, other investors said they would wait to see how the stock performed before buying it. \"I will certainly look at Innogy. But any decision to buy will be made once the price stabilises,\" said Angelo Meda, head of equity and portfolio manager at Banor SIM in Milan. \"In big spin-off deals like this, prices tend to be very volatile for a month or so as investors switch from one stock to the other.\" Another fund manager, Ion-Marc Valahu at Clarinvest, said he wouldn't buy into the IPO because he already owns RWE stock, which he likes because of the dividend it offers. Aching under 28.3 billion euros of net debt, RWE will hold 75-82 percent of Innogy following the listing, depending on the amount of shares sold, handing it a tool to raise cash by selling additional stakes in the future. It wants to remain a majority shareholder in the long term. This stands in contrast to the restructuring process at larger peer E.ON, which wants to sell its remaining 46.65 percent stake in Uniper, but not before 2018. RWE and Innogy have committed not to sell Innogy shares for a period of six months from the first day of trading, scheduled for Oct. 7. The offer period for Innogy shares will run from Sept. 26-Oct. 6. RWE, E.ON and Uniper shares all closed about 1 percent lower on Friday. Sell-side analysts have an average \"hold\" rating on both RWE and E.ON, while Uniper is an average \"buy\". "

The 700 million euros to be invested on average per year are less than the 750 million euros spent per year over the 2012-to-2015 period, presentation slides posted on BASF's website showed.  \"We have competition everywhere. We are under attack all the time. Are we worried about this? No,\" Sanjeev Gandhi, executive board member in charge of Asia, told journalists in London. He added that BASF had to be selective about picking market segments to invest in and would consider seeking partners in areas where BASF has a weaker market position. Growth in the region has slowed recently, the company cautioned. \"China did not grow as fast as we had assumed. We saw low growth in mature Asian markets. India and South East Asia are picking up slightly. Overcapacities in some commodity product lines have contributed to a changing business environment,\" the company statement said. In a sign of how burgeoning Chinese rivals can become a drag on BASF's home markets, the company last week said it would trim European production capacity for a key precursor material for engineering plastics by 20 percent.

    "authour": " Writing by Caroline Stauffer; Editing by Dan Grebler",
    "text": "BUENOS AIRES Even though new rules have not yet been implemented, telecom companies in Argentina are preparing for a more competitive market as the government expects reforms to attract $20 billion in investments over four years. Telecom Argentina (TEC2.BA) and Telefonica de Argentina have announced investments in recent months, while Argentina's largest media conglomerate, Grupo Clarin (CLA.BA), is spinning off subsidiary Cablevision SA, saying in August it could better face competition as a stand-alone unit. Communications Minister Oscar Aguad told Reuters companies, including Motorola and AT&T Inc (T.N), have expressed interest in investing in Argentina, which would mean better services and lower costs for consumers.  \"As long as we are able to dictate a norm with clear rules, I think the figure of $5 billion a year is possible,\" Aguad told Reuters, adding that the investment level should continue for four years. The new rules take effect in 2018. AT&T declined to comment while Motorola Mobility said Argentina is an important market and it continues to look for opportunities here. The telecom reform is one of many changes on President Mauricio Macri's agenda as he tries to drive investment into an economy that was highly regulated, cut off from capital markets and therefore largely ignored by investors for a decade. Shortly after taking office, Macri signed a decree to allow phone companies to offer paid television services, an area that has long been dominated by Cablevisión, Groupo Clarin's internet, cable TV and data transmission subsidiary.  In addition to allowing telephone companies to enter the cable TV market, Macri's government plans to sponsor a new communications law next year that would encourage technological development and competition, according to Silvana Giudici, head of Argentina's telecom regulator.  Telecom Argentina, acquired in March by investment group Fintech, said in July it would invest some $2.6 billion through 2018, while a representative for Telefonica's local branch said it already invested $330 million in the first six months of this year. Fintech is owned by David Martinez, a Mexican financier.  Analysts said mobile brand Claro, owned by Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, could also benefit from the changes.  \"The audiovisual service will allow the company to improve its average revenue per user,\" said a Telefonica executive in Argentina who asked not to be identified.  The executive said the company is seeking more clarity on the reforms before investing in a fiber optic network that would deliver media content to households, however. CHALLENGES  Telecom and Telefonica both remain at a disadvantage to Cablevision and other cable operators, which can offer internet and television through the same fiber optic cable.  Telephone companies would need to improve their network cables in order to deliver television.   In addition to Cablevision, telephone companies have to compete with satellite distributor DirecTV, Supercanal and some 1,000 small cable channels. \"It is very expensive to build a network, and to do it the companies need to know they will recover this cost,\" said Enrique Carrier, a specialist in communications technology with Carrier Asociados. One result of the reforms could be more mergers and acquisitions. Local media and analysts have speculated that once the spin-off of Cablevision from Clarin is complete, it could merge with Telecom and offer a service known as \"quadruple play\" fixed-line and mobile phones, internet and television.  Spain's Telefonica SA (TEF.MC), which owns Telefonica Argentina, has expressed interest in buying pay TV assets in Latin America, sources have told Reuters.  Telecom and Clarin both denied a merger was in the works.  Staying out of the cable market is likely not an option for phone companies wishing to remain competitive.  \"If they do not include the television package, businesses could be left behind,\" said Martín Becerra, a telecommunications specialist at the University of Buenos Aires.

    "text": "BOSTON Investor Michael Gordon has no plans to retire but when he does he wants to ensure that Angelo, Gordon, the $26 billion firm he co-founded with John Angelo 28 years ago, survives without him. To lay the groundwork for an eventual succession, Gordon said the firm created a management committee to run the business and will let senior employee partners buy out the founders' controlling interests over the next five years. \"I have been working closely for the last several months with senior leaders of the firm to develop a strategy that will best position us to transition governance and ownership of the firm to our next generation of leadership,\" Gordon wrote in a letter dated Friday and seen by Reuters. The moves will ensure \"our business continues to thrive long after I retire – which I have no plans to do any time soon,\" Gordon wrote. Gordon will retain a significant, non-controlling interest, he said in the letter. Succession planning has become a critical issue in the $3 trillion hedge fund industry at a time many of the industry's biggest firms are still run by their founders who are edging closer to retirement age.  The changes at Angelo, Gordon come less than a year after John Angelo, its co-founder, died in January of cancer at 74.  The new management committee will meet weekly and include Gordon, who is the firm's chief executive officer and chief investment officer, Deputy Chief Investment Officer Josh Baumgarten, and Adam Schwartz, who heads the U.S. and European real estate business. Baumgarten joined from Blackstone Group earlier this year.   Angelo, Gordon keeps a relatively low profile but is well known for its credit, real estate and private equity businesses. It also has a deep bench of top executives, industry analysts said. The firm was founded in 1988 and at one point invested money for New York City. It also invests for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, according to a disclosure the candidate made. "

    "text": "ZURICH AC Immune (ACIU.O), the Swiss biotech company working on treating Alzheimer's disease, has boosted the size of its initial public offering (IPO) to raise nearly $58 million it needs to continue research on its products. AC Immune will now sell 6 million shares, up from the originally forecast 4.55 million, at $11 each, the bottom end of its indicated range. The shares will trade on Nasdaq. The company also granted underwriters a so-called greenshoe over-allotment option to sell up to 900,000 more shares, it said in a statement on Friday. Excluding the greenshoe, new investors will own 10.8 percent of the company, slightly more than originally planned. The Lausanne-based company did well to get its IPO over the finish line, an analyst said, although the modest price reflects the tough environment for biotech firms amid scrutiny over high drug prices, in particular ahead of U.S. presidential elections. \"People are willing to buy, but not at the prices they were once willing to pay,\" said Bob Pooler of ValuationLab. \"The window for biotech IPOs is slightly open, but it's still a cautious opening.\" The Nasdaq Biotech Index has lost nearly a quarter of its value since peaking in July 2015, despite a recent recovery. Uncertainty over the sector's prospects has been stoked by a debate over the ethics of drug price hikes in the United States, most recently over Mylan's Epipen. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, facing Republican rival Donald Trump, has also pledged to tackle high drug prices.  Despite headwinds, AC Immune, backed by German billionaire Dietmar Hopp, said it was happy with the outcome of its IPO so far. The company, which is working with Swiss drug giant Roche (ROG.S) on its main drug, now expects net proceeds of the IPO at around $57.8 million. The offering, set to close on Sept. 28, values the firm at $609 million. \"Our new investors have diligently evaluated our pipeline and prospects, so this is the value which the market has attributed,\" a spokesman said.     AC Immune's work to combat memory-robbing Alzheimer's is more advanced than that of some other companies, having licensed its experimental drug crenezumab to Roche's Genentech division in 2006.  Crenezumab last year entered final Phase III trials. With money from Roche largely financing crenezumab, AC Immune plans to use proceeds from its U.S. share sale to develop separate products targeting Alzheimer's disease.    Credit Suisse, Jefferies and Leerink Partners are joint book-running managers for the IPO.  "

    "date": "Fri Sep 23, 2016 | 10:03 AM EDT",
    "authour": " Editing by Christopher Mangham and Matthew Davies",
    "text": "LONDON The slower than expected syndication of a US$7.5bn senior acquisition loan, which is part of a US$11.6bn financing backing Analog Devices’(ADI.O) US$14.8bn acquisition of chipmaker Linear Technology (LLTC.O), shows that banks are finding it harder to make returns work on drawn acquisition term loans. The unusually weak demand for an acquisition financing from an investment-grade company comes as the cost of lending rises for banks that have to hold more regulatory capital against loans. “Analog is the first bridge loan for a high grade company to get a poor reception from the market for a long time,” a senior banker said. The US$7.5bn syndicated financing consisted of a US$2.5bn three-year term loan, a US$2.5bn five-year term loan, a US$2.5bn 364-day bridge loan to capital markets issues and a US$1bn revolving credit. A US$4.1bn, 90-day senior unsecured bridge loan was not syndicated. The deal, which was underwritten by JP Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse, was launched in early August.  The deadline was extended to September 19 after relationship banks came in at lower levels and a couple declined, bankers said. The loan has now closed and has been allocated, and Analog has its money. BAML and JP Morgan declined to comment and Credit Suisse was not immediately available for comment. Banks are usually keen to give acquisition bridge loans to top companies as they are often quickly repaid by bond or equity issues. Participation also ensures positions on more lucrative bond and equity issues that subsidize cheaper loans. But banks are targeting higher returns on equity and are becoming more sophisticated at measuring profitability. This is making it harder for lenders to commit to funded term loans that do not hit return models and tie up capital that could be used more profitably elsewhere. “The returns on three and five-year term loans on investment-grade bridge loans are horrible. Some banks are realizing that five-year term loans are dragging their returns back so badly that they can’t make unprofitable lending decisions. Maybe they’re waking up and smelling the coffee,” a second senior banker said. RELATIONSHIP LENDING?  This is putting pressure on the concept of relationship lending that has underpinned the investment-grade syndicated loan market for decades.  Loans have been viewed as “loss leaders” for more lucrative ancillary business, but more banks are now turning down deals that do not pay on a standalone basis. Analog’s three-year term loan was priced at 112.5bp and its five-year term loan at 125bp, which proved challenging even for relationship banks, a syndicate head said. “It’s very hard to make those numbers work,” the second senior banker said. The term loans are new money for Analog and the company also increased the size of its revolving credit facility to US$1bn from US$750m, which required existing lenders to increase their exposure or make new commitments. The company’s position in the technology sector and Triple B credit rating were also considerations, bankers said. S&P lowered Analog’s rating to BBB from A– following the acquisition announcement, with a negative outlook, on July 26. Analog announced the cash and stock acquisition in late July and said that it planned to fund the acquisition with US$7.3bn of new long-term debt, including term loans and bonds, and 58 million new shares of Analog common stock and the combined company’s balance sheet cash. The acquisition is expected to close by mid 2017, subject to approvals. The combined business is valued at about US$30bn. "

Communications is one of the fastest-growing sectors in east Africa's second-biggest economy, with seven mobile players fighting for market share, forcing tariffs lower. Like other African countries, mobile phone use has surged in Tanzania over the past decade, helped by cheaper smartphones, with mobile phone subscribers rising by 25 percent in 2015 to 39.8 million, according to the telecom industry regulator. The government plans to recapitalize cash-strapped Tanzania Telecommunications Corp (TTCL), which provides mobile voice, data and fixed-line services, the president's office said. President John Magufuli appointed Waziri Kindamba as the new acting chief executive after completion of the deal, it added.  TTCL, established in 1993, is the largest fixed line telecommunications company in Tanzania, but has a tiny share of the country's mobile phone market.  TTCL, which also manages and operates the government's national fiber optic cable, competes with Vodacom Tanzania, part of South Africa's Vodacom Group (VODJ.J) , Tigo Tanzania, part of Sweden's Millicom International Cellular (MICsdb.ST) and Halotel, majority-owned by Vietnam-based operator Viettel. The president's office did not say how much Tanzania had paid for the holding, but government officials said last year the deal was worth around $7 million. Talks with Bharti Airtel lasted six years and were delayed by wrangling over price. "

The purchase of around 100 million euros marks another of Slim's incursions into the Spanish market, where the billionaire has amassed majority stakes in builder FCC (FCC.MC) and property firm Realia (RLIA.MC) and launched takeover bids for both.

    "text": "COPENHAGEN Nets NETStemp.CO, issuer of Denmark's most used debit card, was valued at 30 billion Danish crowns ($4.5 billion) in its listing on Friday, nearly double what Advent International, Bain Capital and pension fund ATP paid for it two years ago.  Demand for shares in Scandinavia's largest payments processor exceeded expectations and the initial public offering (IPO) was four days earlier than planned. Nets' listing is one of just a handful of IPOs in the European tech sector this year after a slump and other firms are watching to see if prices hold up enough to justify pushing ahead with their own IPOs. Dutch online food ordering firm Takeaway.com plans to list on its home market this month, while Spanish mobile phone tower business Telxius and German online pharmacy Shop Apotheke Europe are eyeing IPOs in October.  British payments processor Worldpay Group (WPG.L) was listed on the London Stock Exchange in October last year with a valuation of 4.8 billion pounds ($6.34 billion). Shares in Nets opened by as much as 3.3 percent above the offer price of 150 crowns, but had fallen to 148.90 by 0949 GMT. Nets said 36.7 million new shares will be issued, raising gross proceeds of 5.5 billion Danish crowns, while existing shareholders, including private equity firms Advent International and Bain Capital, sold 68.3 million shares. An IPO has been on the table since its 17 billion Danish crown acquisition by Advent, Bain Capital and Denmark's ATP in March 2014. Nets is seen by some investors as more of a long-term investment than a fast IPO return case, Jyske Bank analyst Michael Jorgensen said, with its \"story\" one of Nordic economic stability and a technological width not seen in its peers. The firm's chief financial officer Klaus Pedersen called the IPO a success, but said competition in the industry was intense.  \"Our advantage is that we have a wide range of products covering pretty much all payment solutions, and we have scale and volume that gives us low unit costs. That is where start-up fintech companies meet challenges,\" Pedersen told Reuters. He expects Nets to grow revenue organically by about 6 percent this year and by 5-6 percent in the following three years. That compares against an industry that is expected to grow by 4 percent per year until 2020, he said. Approximately 42,000 new shareholders have been allocated shares and Nets said an overallotment option of an additional 15.75 existing shares could bring the total offering size to as much as 18.11 billion Danish crowns. The company's free float will be between 52 percent and 60 percent, depending on the overallotment size. Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and Nordea were joint global co-ordinators and joint bookrunners for the IPO. Nets said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization before special items (EBITDA) rose 13 percent to 1.2 billion Danish crowns in the first six months of 2016 corresponding to an EBITDA margin of 33.4 percent. Nets wants to lift this to 35 percent this year from 32.9 percent last year, and aims to increase it to the \"high 30s\" over the next three years.  The company is likely to enter the Danish leading index OMXC20 with the 20 largest and most actively traded shares on Nasdaq Copenhagen when it is revised in December, Jyske Bank's Jorgensen said. "

    "text": "SHANGHAI Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group will market Sony Pictures' films and co-finance some upcoming movie releases of Sony Corp's film unit in China, which is forecast to become the world's top movie market as soon as next year. Wanda, owned by China's richest man, Wang Jianlin, and Sony announced a deal on Friday under which Sony Pictures will utilize China's biggest theater chain owner Wanda to better access a rapidly growing yet restricted movie market. The alliance will help Wanda extend its Hollywood footprint and further Wang's goal of making the group a global entertainment powerhouse. Wanda said in a statement on its website the tie-up would use its consumer-facing infrastructure to bolster Sony Pictures' presence in China, which is on track to surpass the United States as the world's biggest probably by next year, according to industry executives. \"This partnership makes a lot of sense for both parties. Sony will benefit from smoother distribution and playback of its films in China and Wanda will be able to further integrate into the content development side of the business,\" said Ben Cavender, Shanghai-based principal of China Market Research Group.  \"We are going to see more cooperation going forward...Tie ups make sense because a lot of Chinese companies are also becoming interested in film financing as a form of investment,\" he said.  This would be Sony Pictures' first partnership with Wanda, which has previously invested in movies made by Viacom Inc's Paramount Pictures unit, such as \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" sequel, and would give Wanda a step into movie marketing.    Despite an economic slowdown and dipping ticket sales, China showed how it could still be a savior for Hollywood producers in June after Universal's $160 million blockbuster \"Warcraft\" managed to chalk up $156 million in China in the first five days despite flopping in the United States. But the country's regulator restricts the number of imported films that theaters can show to 34 a year, a limit that films which qualify as co-productions and meet other criteria are exempt from. These films also have an easier time navigating censorship issues with notoriously picky industry watchdogs. Profits at Sony's film unit fell 34 percent over the year to March after it struggled to achieve hits at the box office over that period.  Wanda declined to provide further details on the deal. Sony was not immediately available to comment.  HOLLYWOOD DREAMS Started by Wang as a property developer in China's northeast, Wanda now owns theaters, massive shopping malls and amusements parks around the country.  The billionaire has said he wants to bring Hollywood technology and capabilities to China through acquisitions, telling Reuters in August that he was keen to buy Hollywood's \"Big Six\" studios and was close to sealing two billion-dollar film related deals. Wanda already owns Legendary, co-producer of hits such as \"Jurassic World\" and \"The Dark Knight\", which was the biggest U.S.-China movie deal when it was sealed in January, and U.S. cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings. Besides Wanda, Chinese companies that have invested in Hollywood include Fosun International and Huayi Brothers Media Corp. "

    "text": "HONG KONG Lufax, China's biggest peer-to-peer lending platform backed by Ping An Insurance (2318.HK)(601318.SS), is in talks with four investment banks about taking leading roles in its planned Hong Kong IPO, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The initial public offering could raise $5 billion, Thomson Reuters publication IFR reported previously . CITIC Securities (600030.SS) (6030.HK), Citigroup (C.N), JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) have started preparatory work, although no formal mandate has been awarded, the people said. The timing and size of the IPO are still undetermined, but the four banks are likely to land the key sponsor roles for the deal, they said, declining to be identified as the information has not been officially disclosed. Lufax, valued at $18.5 billion in a January fundraising, would be the first peer-to-peer (P2P) platform to list in Hong Kong. The IPO comes at a time of surging growth in P2P lending  and will test investor appetite for a new breed of companies that threaten to disrupt the traditional financial industry. Lufax and Ping An declined to comment. CITIC CLSA, the Hong Kong investment banking unit of CITIC Securities, Citigroup and JPMorgan also declined to comment. Morgan Stanley did not offer an immediate response. Peer-to-peer platforms help link up individual or institutional investors looking to invest their cash with borrowers including small- and medium-enterprises, students and other individuals that need funding. Those companies are part of a booming financial technology (fintech) industry in China that hopes to offer a young and increasingly affluent population speedy and easy-to-use services on their mobile phones. The volume of Chinese P2P loans stood at 680.3 billion yuan ($102 billion) at the end of August, more than 20 times levels seen in January 2014, according to industry data provider Wangdaizhijia. That could swell to 880 billion yuan by the end of 2016 and to 1.5 trillion yuan by the end of 2018, according to estimates from Nomura. But P2P lending has also drawn much scrutiny from regulators. Seeking to head off rising risks in the market, Chinese authorities implemented aggressive steps including requiring borrowing limits and the use of third-party banks as custodians of investor funds in P2P platforms. The measures will probably leave China with 200-300 P2P players by this time next year from more than 4,000 now, Lufax CFO James Zheng said in late August. Lufax had over 23.3 million users at end-June, Ping An said in its first-half earnings report, more than double a year earlier. Trading volumes totalled 3.2 trillion yuan ($480 billion) over the same period, compared with 512 million yuan in the first half of 2015. ($1 = 6.6693 Chinese yuan) "

    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR At least three firms including Peugeot maker PSA (PEUP.PA) have signaled interest in a deal with ailing Malaysian carmaker Proton, people familiar with the matter said, as the faded brand's owner seeks to sell a stake in a company once seen as a symbol of the country's drive to industrialize.  The search by Malaysian conglomerate DRB-Hicom (DRBM.KL) is the latest in a long series of efforts to find a partner to help revive Proton after years of profit being hit by sub-par cars, poor after-sales service and tough competition. The government gave Proton 1.5 billion ringgit ($365 million) in financial aid in April.  A Paris-based spokesman for PSA said, \"Peugeot confirms it is responding to a request for proposals initiated by Proton and its shareholder.\" The spokesman declined to comment on what PSA's response would be, or the nature of the proposals requested by Proton. One person familiar with the matter said Proton sent partnership proposals to nearly 20 carmakers earlier this year. Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp (7269.T) and French carmaker Renault SA (RENA.PA) are also responding to Proton's request for proposals, people said.  Suzuki and Renault officials declined to comment. While Proton's fortunes have waned since its 1990s heyday, the potential attraction for foreign partners would be access to its under-utilized manufacturing capacity: Proton has two manufacturing facilities in Malaysia that can make up to 400,000 cars annually, though it sold just 102,000 cars last year. Foreign firms could look to make their cars in Proton's facilities to export around the economic growth hotspots of Southeast Asia, people familiar with the matter said. These people declined to be identified because the discussions around Proton's future were confidential. DRB-Hicom has not ruled out selling a majority stake in Proton, the people said, and may also consider selling British sports and racing car brand Lotus, owned by Proton.     Proton and DRB-Hicom did not immediately respond to requests for comment. PREVIOUS SEARCH FAILURE  Founded in 1983 during former Malaysian premier Mahathir Mohamed's industrialization push, Proton at its peak boasted a domestic market share of 74 percent in 1993, largely re-badging cars of foreign manufacturers to sell in the domestic market. But after years of being plagued by quality and service issues, and with move to produce its own models failing to impress consumers, its market share has plummeted to about 15 percent.  DRB doesn't disclose Proton financial statements separately, but said it incurred a pre-tax loss of 821.27 million ringgit in fiscal 2015, largely due to losses from Proton. While agreeing to support Proton in April, the government said its business model wasn't sustainable, and that it needed to find a strategic foreign partner. Industry players say Proton also badly needs research and development support from a foreign partner if it is to build a viable future strategy.  \"If Proton need to develop their own technology or design, they need more money,\" said Titikorn Lertsirirungsun, ASEAN manager at consultancy LMC Automotive. \"But this is a big challenge for Proton given that its production volume is very low.\"  Industry watchers expect the potential terms of any prospective partnership - including whether a majority or minority stake of Proton is to be sold - may determine whether the current revival drive fares better than previous attempts. In 2007, for instance, Proton's search for a foreign partner attracted industry giants Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and General Motors (GM.N). But talks with the pair were called off after Malaysia declined to give them a controlling stake. ($1 = 4.1145 ringgit) "

Several German car parts makers have been looking to buy Haldex, keen on its expertise in brakes for trailers in particular as they seek to develop integrated autonomous driving systems for commercial vehicles. Knorr-Bremse and ZF are the two remaining bidders, and Haldex has strongly recommended shareholders accept ZF's 120 crown per share bid despite it being lower than Knorr's 125 crown bid, citing possible antitrust concerns with a takeover by Knorr-Bremse. \"The acquisition of a further stake in Haldex again confirms the attractiveness of our offer to the shareholders of the company. It reflects the positive feedback from investors which we received over the last days\", Knorr-Bremse Chief Executive Klaus Deller said in a statement. Haldex Chief Executive Bo Annvik joined ZF's news conference at IAA commercial vehicles trade show on Wednesday and warned that a protracted vetting process for a Knorr-Bremse takeover could cause some customers to jump ship. \"We have clear indications that the recent statements by the management of Haldex with regard to our offer are not shared by a number of investors,\" Deller said. Knorr-Bremse, which bought the additional 3.56 percent stake from Carnegie Fonder at 125 crowns per share, also changed its terms for the bid entitling shareholders to compensation in case of a new higher offer. ZF owns a 21.2 percent stake in Haldex.  "

    "text": "Texas regulators voiced \"deep concern\" on Thursday over some terms of NextEra Energy Inc's (NEE.N) $18.4 billion acquisition of reorganized Energy Future Holdings Corp, the owner of an 80 percent stake in electricity transmission and distribution company Oncor Electric Delivery Co.  Public Utility Commission of Texas member Kenneth Anderson Jr said during a public meeting held by the regulator that the biggest issue revolves around a $275 million termination fee in the agreement. He said he planned to file a memo next week that lays out his concerns.  \"There are some provisions in there that raise deep concern and I wanted to get them out there,\" Anderson said.  The conditions that trigger the breakup fee amount to an “improper attempt” to limit the commission in its duty to regulate for the public interest, he said. Public Utility Commission of Texas Chairman Donna Nelson said she agreed with Anderson, according to a recording of the meeting published on the regulator's website.  Energy Future Holdings and NextEra declined to comment. In court papers, Energy Future said the $275 million termination fee is comparable on a percentage basis to fees in other transactions of publicly traded utility companies. Regulatory issues have dogged the bankruptcy of Energy Future, which filed in April 2014 with $42 billion in debt. It won court approval for the bulk of its operations to exit bankruptcy last month, but the Oncor stake remains in Chapter 11, with a confirmation hearing scheduled for later this year. Other plans to sell Oncor to a group of creditors and investors led by privately held Hunt Consolidated Inc of Texas collapsed last year after it hit regulatory hurdles. Hunt Consolidated and Berkshire Hathaway Inc's (BRKa.N)  energy subsidiary MidAmerican Energy have both shown interest in reorganized Energy Future and its Oncor stake, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Oncor, which operates the largest transmission and distribution system in Texas, is prized for its steady cash flow. When its deal to acquire the Oncor stake was announced, NextEra said it expected it would be meaningfully accretive to its earnings. The merger between NextEra and reorganized Energy Future Holdings received approval from a U.S. bankruptcy court earlier this week. They plan to soon file a joint application to the Public Utility Commission of Texas for approval of the deal, but on Thursday one had not yet been received, according to a spokesman for the Commission.

The move illustrates how Vanda is seeking to capitalize on an anticipated wave of deal making in the sector. Advances in treating several serious neurological diseases have attracted  interest and resources from major drug makers. Vanda is holding conversations with investment banks about appointing a financial adviser to help it review its options, the people said this week. Vanda has explored selling itself in the past, and there is no certainty the latest move will result in any deal, the people cautioned. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Vanda declined to comment. The company's shares jumped as much as 16 percent on the news and ended trading on Thursday up 7 percent at $16.62, giving Vanda a market capitalization of $719 million. Washington, D.C.-based Vanda makes two neurological drugs, Hetlioz and Fanapt, which treat sleep disorders and schizophrenia, respectively. Together, they brought in about $100 million in revenues in 2015.  Vanda is researching wider indications for Hetlioz, including its potential use in treating sleep disturbances associated with Smith-Magenis syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. Vanda is also working on a drug that has the potential to treat a severe form of dermatitis. It is in phase two clinical trials.   Earlier this summer, a court ruled in favor of Vanda in its lawsuit against Roxane Laboratories Inc, a generic drug maker that challenged Fanapt's patent protection. Vanda now enjoys patent protection for Fanapt through 2027.  In a sign that deal making in the sector is picking up, Arbor Pharmaceuticals acquired XenoPort Inc, a developer of neurological drugs, in July for $467 million, a 60 percent premium to the closing price of its shares before the deal was signed. Several other central nervous system drug makers have attracted takeover interest in recent weeks, including GW Pharmaceuticals Plc (GWP.L), which has a drug that promises to treat rare forms of epilepsy, Reuters reported earlier this month.   Depomed Inc (DEPO.O), whose drug Nucynta treats pain, is also preparing to explore a sale, Reuters reported last week. In recent months, Allergan Plc (AGN.N), one of the biggest players in the central nervous system sector, has been seeking to deploy around $20 billion in cash gleaned from a recent deal with Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA.TA).

    "text": "Lennar Corp (LEN.N), the No. 2 U.S. homebuilder, said it would buy fellow Florida-based homebuilder WCI Communities Inc (WCIC.N) for about $643 million, boosting its land bank in one of the fastest improving housing markets in the United States. The deal comes two days after Lennar, which mainly caters to buyers looking for a second home, said its profit margins were being hurt due to rising land and labor costs. The deal will help Lennar boost its lot count in Florida by about 14,200 sites to 173,000, and increase its pipeline of available land to 7 years from 6 years, Susquehanna Financial Group estimated. UBS estimated Florida accounted for about 30 percent of Lennar's home closings in 2015. The housing market in Florida has improved the most since last year and the state also accounted for four of the top five most improved metro areas, including Orlando and Tampa, Freddie Mac said in a report in July. (mwne.ws/2cor1aC) Lennar offered $23.50 per WCI share, half in cash and half in stock. However, WCI shares rose as much as 41.5 percent to $24.28 on Thursday, never once falling below the offer price, indicating investors were expecting a rival bid or for Lennar to raise its price. While bids from Toll Brothers Inc (TOL.N) or Tri Pointe Group Inc (TPH.N) could make sense given the type of houses, prices and geography, Lennar could squeeze the most from the deal as they are already present in Florida, said Susquehanna analyst Jack Micenko. Susquehanna is a market maker in the securities of Lennar and WCI. WCI said it had 35 days to shop for a higher offer. Lennar said it had the option of increasing the cash portion of its offer, including paying the full amount in cash. WCI builds single-family and multi-family luxury homes that cater mostly to move-up buyers – a more profitable demographic for homebuilders as they often get financing more easily than first-time buyers. \"WCI's land portfolio dovetails perfectly with our own Florida footprint and expands our product offering to capture more of the move-up market,\" Lennar Chief Executive Stuart Miller said in a statement. The transaction gives WCI an enterprise value of $809 million, Lennar said. WCI's financial advisers are Credit Suisse and Citigroup Global Markets Inc and its legal advisers are Latham & Watkins LLP. Lennar's legal adviser is Goodwin Procter LLP and Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP is its special tax counsel. "

    "text": "COPENHAGEN The world's biggest shipping firm, A.P. Moller-Maersk, set a new course on Thursday that will see the $30 billion firm bulk up its transport business while seeking alliances or a separate listing for its energy operations. Low freight rates and oversupply have rocked the container shipping sector, with South Korea's Hanjin Shipping Co Ltd forced into receivership last month, stranding an estimated $14 billion in cargo on its ships. Maersk, with a fleet of more than 600 ships, will focus its attention on building up its transport and logistics operations despite these problems, while creating a separate energy division combining Maersk Oil and three related companies. The latter will be split from the main company individually or in combination \"in the form of joint-ventures, mergers or listing\", within two years Maersk, which is controlled by the Maersk family and was founded in 1904 by A.P. Moller, said. The spin-off should allow Maersk to shed any conglomerate discount by allowing markets to value each of its businesses. Estimates for the sum of the parts vary, with Denmark's Sydbank saying the Transport and Logistics division could be worth $26-$35 billion and the Energy division possibly $11-$23 billion, while Barclays analysts say a standalone Maersk Oil would currently have a market value of around $4.7 billion. \"Separating our transport and logistics businesses and our oil and oil related businesses... will enable both to focus on their respective markets. Both face very different underlying fundamentals and competitive environments,\" Chairman Michael Pram Rasmussen said in a statement. The shake-up will be led by Soren Skou, the 52-year-old chief executive of Maersk Line who became group CEO in June. He  will lead the new Transport and Logistics division, while Maersk Drilling boss Claus V. Hemmingsen will head the Energy unit. Shares in Maersk, which have risen by more than 20 percent since June in anticipation of the strategic review, climbed 3.4 percent on the news and were at 10,240 crowns at 1516 GMT. PAIN-FREE SOLUTION Some analysts and investor, however, said the 112-year-old company had not gone far enough. \"It might be one of the most pain-free solutions relative to other scenarios, but they could have gone even further,\" Nykredit analyst Ricky Rasmussen said, suggesting the group could have been cut into four units. The weak shipping market has hit the top companies which have invested heavily in \"mega-ships\", largely to operate on the main Asia to Europe trade route, with industry analysts questioning whether there is enough work for them Otto Friedrichsen, equity strategist at Danish asset manager Formuepleje, with around 45 billion Danish crowns allocated in bonds and equities, has shunned the shipping industry including Maersk, and was skeptical about the split. \"I still want to see changes in the underlying markets and don't see this as creating any value here and now.\" Maersk's second-quarter group net profit of $101 million was well below the $196 million expected by analysts. \"We had a quite poor second quarter, but some players have it much worse than we do, which we also saw with Hanjin,\" Rasmussen told Reuters after the split was announced. South Korea's Hanjin Shipping Co Ltd, the world's seventh largest container carrier, filed for court receivership in late August. Rasmussen expects a recent wave of consolidation to intensify, and told Reuters that Maersk is ready to use its cash reserves of close to $12 billion to buy up competitors. \"The Chinese shipping companies are now uniting forces because they are under pressure. In the long run, no one finds it amusing to run a loss-making business,\" Rasmussen said. Clustered with Maersk Line in the Transport and Logistics division will be APM Terminals, Damco, Svitzer and Maersk Container Industry, which together accounted for more than 75 percent of the group's first-half revenue. Maersk Oil and related firms such as Maersk Drilling have grappled with stubbornly low oil prices which remain 60 percent below mid-2014 levels. Grouping the two energy firms with Maersk Supply Service and Maersk Tankers was a positive first step toward exiting the sector, said analyst Morten Imsgard at Sydbank.     \"It was as far as Maersk could go right now, because they could not have a ready-made solution for the energy division in these markets, if they also want to realise a decent price for the assets,\" he said. \"Maersk Oil...is a small player, so there are many players big enough to take (it) in. (Maersk) Drilling is relatively large, but its competitors are under extreme financial pressure, so it's less likely to find an sale opportunity there.\" Earlier banking sources told Reuters that Maersk was in talks to buy a portfolio of North Sea oil assets from Royal Dutch Shell as it considers scaling up the oil and gas business ahead of a spin-off.

    "text": "LONDON A.P. Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) is in talks to buy a portfolio of North Sea assets from Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) as the Danish group considers adding scale to its oil and gas business ahead of a planned spin off, banking sources said. Maersk announced on Thursday a major overhaul that will see it focus on its core transport and logistics businesses, while looking at options for its energy division within 24 months that could include a joint venture, merger or listing. Maersk has said over the past year that it planned to invest several billions of dollars to expand its oil operations, although it is now likely to face bigger financial pressures given a rout in earnings from shipping, weak oil prices and the loss of a major oil contract in Qatar. Maersk Oil has held talks in recent weeks about buying a large part of the North Sea portfolio that Shell is seeking to sell as part of a three-year, $30 billion divestment plan following its purchase of BG Group earlier this year, banking sources involved in the talks told Reuters. The assets under discussion are valued at around $2 billion, they added. Shell and Maersk Oil declined to comment. Although the aging UK North Sea is considered a relatively costly oil region, Maersk - which already has assets there - believes it can reduce the costs of running Shell's fields as well as the costs of dismantling and cleaning up assets nearing the end of their production lives, the sources said. Explaining Maersk's options for its energy business, one source with knowledge of the process said: \"They could look to bulk it up potentially with merger combinations before an exit – the key is to make it attractive to get the value they want.\"   Maersk Oil is currently developing the Culzean gas field which is expected to start production in 2019 and which could supply up to 5 percent of Britain's gas demand.  The division produces around 500,000 barrels per day of oil and gas equivalent around the world, according to its website.    Barclays analysts estimate Maersk Oil would currently have a market value of around $4.7 billion as a standalone business.  Maersk Oil has suffered a series of setbacks, first and foremost when Qatar chose not to extend its 25-year license to operate the giant Al Shaheen field. Its plans to develop a huge offshore field in Angola also stalled as it struggled to reduce costs. In February, Maersk tumbled to a loss after writing down Maersk Oil's assets by $2.6 billion. Still, many of the division's assets are considered attractive, including its stake in Norway's giant Johan Sverdrup oil field development. \"The energy-division is sort of cut off with a 'For sale' sign in the window,\" Sydbank analyst Morten Imsgard said. \"Maersk Oil is a small player in a larger context, so there are many players big enough to take in Maersk Oil. Drilling is relatively large, but its competitors are under extreme financial pressure, so Maersk is less likely to find a sell-off opportunity there.\"   "
